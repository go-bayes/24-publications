title: "Causal Effects of Religious Service Attendance on Charity and Volunteering: Evidence Using Novel Measures From A National Longitudinal Panel"
shorttitle: "Causal Effects of Religious Service"
abstract: |
   Causal investigations for the effects of religion on prosociality must be precise. One should articulate a specific causal contrast for a feature of religion, select appropriate prosociality measures, define the target population, gather time-series data, and, only after identification assumptions are met, conduct statistical and sensitivity analyses. Here, we examine three distinct interventions on religious service attendance (increase, decrease, maintain) in a longitudinal sample of 33,198 New Zealanders (years 2018 to 2021). Study 1 investigates effects of religious service on charitable contributions and volunteerism. Studies 2 and 3 investigate effects of religious service on the relative risks of *receiving* aid or financial support from others during the past week -- measures designed to minimise self-reporting bias. Across all studies, inferred causal effects are substantially less pronounced than observed cross-sectional associations. Nonetheless, regular attendance across the population would enhance charitable donations by 4% of the New Zealand Government's annual spending. This research underscores the essential role of formulating precise causal questions and recommends a workflow for answering them in the scientific study of cultural practices.
