\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
The question: ``does religion causes prosociality?'' is a poorly defined
question. To make it precise, we must state a causal contrast on a
well-defined feature of religion, specify measures of ``prosociality''
on which to assess effects, and clarify the target population for whom
results are meant to generalise. Here, we contrast three hypothetical
interventions on religious service attendance and examine their effects
on three measures of prosociality across the population of New Zealand
from 2018-2022. Study 1 investigates the effects on self-reported social
behaviours; Study 2 investigates effects on reported hours of help
received from others; Study 3 investigates the effects of reported money
received from others. The latter two measures avoid self-presentation
bias. Each study finds evidence that religion supports pro-social
behaviours However, magnitudes of benefit vary depending on the causal
contrast of interest. Overall, both the gain and loss of regular
religious service attendance have considerable economic consequences for
charitable donations, whose ``cash value'' we compute. Collectively,
these findings document the social consequences of religious behaviours
and offer a blue-print quantitative causal investigations of the effects
of cultural practices.
\end{abstract}

\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}

A central question in the scientific study of religion is whether
religion causes cooperation. However, to address this question is
challenging. Most features of religion are inaccessible to experiments.
Yet to obtain valid causal inferences from non-experimental data
requires a combination of high-resolution time-series data and robust
causal inferential methods. Few studies that combine these features.
(see Kelly \emph{et al.} (\citeproc{ref-kelly2024religiosity}{2024}),
although for indirect causal evidence see Sosis and Bressler
(\citeproc{ref-sosis2003cooperation}{2003}); for an appropriately
designed observational study of religious service on mental health, a
different topic, see
(\citeproc{ref-chen2020religious}{\textbf{chen2020religious?}})).

Equally fundamental, the question: ``does religion cause prosociality?''
is poorly defined. To make this question precise, we must state a causal
contrasts of interest, state specific measures of ``prosociality'' to be
evaluated, and define the target population for whom results are meant
to generalise (Hernan and Robins
(\citeproc{ref-hernan2024WHATIF}{2024}); Ogburn and Shpitser
(\citeproc{ref-ogburn2021}{2021}); Bulbulia
(\citeproc{ref-bulbulia2022}{2022})).

Here, we leverage comprehensive panel data from 46377 who participated
in the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study from 2018-2021 and
investigate the effects of well-defined population-level shifts in
religious attendance across three measurement domains of pro-sociality.

Following the Neyman-Rubin causal model, we define causal effects as
quantitative contrasts of potential outcomes under different treatments
regimes in a target population (\citeproc{ref-neyman1923}{Neyman 1923};
\citeproc{ref-rubin2005}{Rubin 2005}).

The first causal contrast asks: ``what would be difference on average
across the population of New Zealand if everyone attended religious
service regularly (defined as at least four times per month) compared
with if no one ever attended religious service?'' This question holds
theoretical interest. It is akin to a hypothetical experiment in which
everyone is randomly assigned eiether to regular or zero-attendance
condition.

The second causal contrast asks: ``what would be difference on average
across the population of New Zealand if everyone attended religious
service regularly compared with the status quo?'' Notice that this
causal contrast does not require shifting those people who regularly
attend religious services to zero attendance. This causal question
clarifies the implications of policies that target the behaviours of
those who do not attend regular religious service.

The second causal contrast asks: ``what would be difference on average
across the population of New Zealand if no one attended religious
service at all compared with the status quo?'' Here the potential
outcomes of interest do not require shifting who never attend religious
service. This causal question clarifies the implications of policies
that target the behaviours of those who attend regular religious
service.

Note that there are inumerably many causal contrasts we mind consider.
Those that we consider here give insights into the distinct effect of
loss and gain of religious behaviour on society-wide averages of
prosociality, defined by the indicators presented below.

\subsection{Method}\label{method}

\subsubsection{Sample}\label{sample}

Data were collected as part of The New Zealand Attitudes and Values
Study (NZAVS), an annual longitudinal national probability panel study
of social attitudes, personality, ideology and health outcomes in New
Zealand. Chris G. Sibley started the NZAVS in 2009. It has since grown
to a community of over fifty researchers. Since its inception, the NZAVS
has collected questionnaire responses from 72910 New Zealand residents.
The NZAVS is university-based, not-for-profit and independent of
political or corporate funding; see
https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/75SNB. Sample descriptive information
for this study are given in Appendices B-D.

\subsubsection{Measures of prosociality}\label{measures-of-prosociality}

There are two self-reported measures of prosocial behaviour in the
NZAVS:

\textbf{Study 1. Self-reported charity} as measured by:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\alph{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  self-reported hours of weekly volunteering;
\item
  self-reported annual financial donations (dollars);
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Study 2: Reported help received in hours} in the previous week
from:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\alph{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  family (coded: yes/no)
\item
  friends (coded: yes/no)
\item
  community (coded: yes/no)
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Study 3: Reported financial help received in dollars} in the
previous week from:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\alph{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  family (coded: yes/no)
\item
  friends (coded: yes/no)
\item
  community (coded: yes/no)
\end{enumerate}

Details about all measures are provided in \emph{Appendix A.}

Studies 2 and 3 minimise self-presentation bias by using individuals as
measures of prosocial outcomes based on the following assumption: if
religious service attendance induced greater within-group prosociality,
then regular religious service attendance would increase prosocial
exposures. Self-reported dependency are robust to directed
self-presentation bias that might induce the appearance of a causal
association between religious service attendance and prosocial
behaviour.

\subsubsection{Causal Contrasts}\label{causal-contrasts}

The contrasts of interest in this study take the form of longitudinal
modified treatment policies. To precisely state these policies, let
\(A\) denote the intervention of interest monthly frequency of religious
service. Our treatment policies evaluate interventions that take the
form of differing shift functions \(f(A)\):

\[
d(A) = 
\begin{cases} 
a, & \text{where } a \text{ is the observed value.}\\
a^* = 4, & \text{if } a < 4 \times \text{monthly religious service attendance; otherwise, } a^* = a.\\
a' = 0, & \text{if } a > 0 \text{ and monthly religious service attendance is positive; otherwise, } a' = a. 
\end{cases}
\]

where,

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{for \(d(A=a)\)}: the observed value of \(a\) remains
  unchanged. Estimation is performed for the observed value.
\item
  \textbf{for \(d(A =a^*)\)}: \(a^* = 4\) if the observed value of \(a\)
  is less than four times the monthly religious service attendance. If
  the observed value of \(a\) is four or greater, no intervention is
  performed, and \(a^*\) equals \(a\). This function enforces a minimum
  threshold for religious attendance at four but allows those who meet
  or exceed this threshold to remain unchanged.
\item
  \textbf{for \(a^\prime\)}: this condition modifies \(a\) to \(a' = 0\)
  when the observed value of \(a\) is greater than 0, thus setting all
  values of religious attendance to 0 if they are not already at 0.
  Again, the intervention only applies to those who attend religious
  services at any frequency.
\end{itemize}

We next formulate our causal contrasts precisely. Let \(Y(\bar{a})\)
denote a potential outcome at the end of the study under the treatment
rule \(d(A)\). In this three-wave panel study, we consider two
intervention intervals, one at baseline and one at the baseline + 1
wave. Outcomes are subsequently assessed in the baseline + 2 wave. \(L\)
denotes the set of measured covariates we assume sufficient for
confounding control. Measurements of \(L\) are obtained from the
baseline wave. Because causes precede effects, panel data allow us to
order measurements such that confounders \(L\) preceded causes \(A\) and
causes \(A\) precede effects \(Y\).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Our first causal question asks: ``What would be the social
  consequences one year after an intervention in which everyone attended
  religious service for two years compared with an intervention in which
  no one attended religious service for two years?'' For continuous
  outcomes, we compute the causal contrast from this longitudinal
  modified treatment policy (LMTP) on the difference scale as:
\end{enumerate}

\[ \text{LMTP: ALL GAIN vs ALL LOSS} = E[Y(a*,a*)|\textcolor{red}{d(A)},L] - E[Y(a^\prime,a^\prime)|\textcolor{red}{d(A)},L] \]

Again this causal question reflects a classical theoretical interest in
which we compare the population estimates with everyone attending
regularly vs the population estimates with no one attending regularly on
each measurement domain of interest.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  Our second causal question asks: ``What would be the social
  consequences if everyone who was not attending weekly religious
  service in New Zealand were to do so?'' The contrast conditions for
  this estimand are given by (a) regular religious service attendance
  and (b) the status quo, which can be written on the difference scale:
\end{enumerate}

\[  \text{LMTP: ALL GAIN vs. STATUS QUO}  = E[Y(a*,a*)|\textcolor{red}{d(A)},L] - E[Y(a,a)|\textcolor{red}{d(A)},L] \]

Again this causal question reflects a practical interest in comparing
the population estimates with everyone attending regularly vs the
population at its status quo on each measurement domain of interest. The
question helps us understand the implications of promoting religious
service attendance.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  Our third causal question asks: ``What would be the social
  consequences if everyone attending weekly religious service in New
  Zealand were to stop?'' The contrast conditions for this estimand are
  given by (a) no religious service attendance and (b) the status quo,
  which can be written on the difference scale:
\end{enumerate}

\[ \text{LMTP: ALL LOSS vs. STATUS QUO}  = E[Y(a^\prime,a^\prime)|\textcolor{red}{d(A)},L] - E[Y(a,a)|\textcolor{red}{d(A)},L] \]

This contrast allows us to evaluate the social effects of a policy that
promoted the society-wide loss of religious service attendance in the
contemporary population. In the case of New Zealand, where religious
service is on the decline, we may use this quantity to clarify the
social consequences of failing to prevent loss.

\subsubsection{Identification
assumptions}\label{identification-assumptions}

To obtain valid causal effect estimates, we must satisfy three
identification assumptions.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Causal consistency}: each outcome observed in the data
  corresponds to at least one of the potential outcomes to be contrasted
  {[}{]}. Moreover, multiple treatment versions must be independent of
  the potential outcomes conditional on measured covariates {[}{]}.
\item
  \textbf{Conditional exchangeability}: given the observed covariates,
  treatment assignment is independent of the potential outcomes under
  consideration. Put differently, our statistical models obtain balance
  in confounding covariates across the treatments of interest.
\end{enumerate}

To improve the credibility of this assumption, we conduct analysis using
semi-parametric doubly robust estimators, as explained below.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Positivity}: every subject has a non-zero probability of
  receiving each treatment to be compared. Below, we evaluate the
  positivity assumption by reporting the number of instances in which
  individuals transitioned from one state of religious service in the
  baseline wave to another in the treatment wave.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Target Population}\label{target-population}

The target population is the population of New Zealand at the baseline
wave (years 2018-2019). The New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study is a
national probability study with a good representation of the New Zealand
population. However, its coverage is not perfect. For example, the study
under-samples males and Asians and over-samples women and Māori (New
Zealand's indigenous peoples). Therefore, we pass New Zealand Census
survey weights when computing marginal treatment effects; in this study
we weighted the sample to age, gender and ethnicity. Methods for these
weights are described in {[}{]}.

\subsubsection{Eligibility criteria}\label{eligibility-criteria}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Enrolled in the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study in 2018 (NZAVS
  time 10).
\item
  No missing data about religious service attendance at baseline (NZAVS
  time 10)
\item
  Missing data for all variables at baseline were allowed and imputed
  using the \texttt{ppm} algorithm from the \texttt{mice} package
  (\citeproc{ref-vanbuuren2018}{Van Buuren 2018}).
\item
  Attrition/loss to follow-up was permitted. Targeted learning models
  that compute censoring weights were calculated as part of estimation
  in \texttt{lmtp} to adjust for missing outcomes at NZAVS Time 12
  (years 2020-2021, the outcome wave). See details of the \texttt{lmtp}
  package (\citeproc{ref-williams2021}{Williams and Díaz 2021}))
\end{itemize}

There were 46377 who met these criteria.

\subsubsection{Confounding control}\label{confounding-control}

We use VanderWeele \emph{et al.} (\citeproc{ref-vanderweele2020}{2020})
\emph{modified disjunctive cause criterion} in which we (1) identified
all common causes of the treatment and outcomes; (2) removed any
variables identified that might influence the exposure but not the
outcome -- instrumental variables -- because instrumental variables are
known to reduce efficiency; (3) included proxies for any unmeasured
variables affecting both exposure and outcome -- including instrumental
variables, because by the rules of d-separation, conditioning on a proxy
is akin to conditioning on its parent (in this case, a confounder) (4)
\textbf{control for baseline exposure} and (5) \textbf{control for
baseline outcome} Both serve as proxies for unmeasured common causes
(\citeproc{ref-vanderweele2020}{VanderWeele \emph{et al.} 2020}). Note
that our shift interventions obtain controlled effects for baseline
treatment and exposure wave treatment, with the naturally observed
treatment levels being explicitly modelled from the data, see {[}{]} for
details.

\paragraph{Sensitivity Analysis Using the
E-value}\label{sensitivity-analysis-using-the-e-value}

To assess the sensitivity of results to unmeasured confounding, we
report VanderWeele and Ding's ``E-value'' in all analyses
(\citeproc{ref-vanderweele2017}{VanderWeele and Ding 2017}). The E-value
quantifies the minimum strength of association (on the risk ratio scale)
that an unmeasured confounder would need to have with both the exposure
and the outcome (after considering the measured covariates) to explain
away the observed exposure-outcome association
(\citeproc{ref-linden2020EVALUE}{Linden \emph{et al.} 2020};
\citeproc{ref-vanderweele2020}{VanderWeele \emph{et al.} 2020}). To
evaluate the strength of evidence, we use the bound of the E-value 95\%
confidence interval closest to 1.

\subsubsection{Analytic Approach}\label{analytic-approach}

We employ a semi-parametric Targeted Learning, specifically Targeted
Minimum Loss-based Estimation (TMLE) estimator. TMLE is a robust method
that combines machine learning techniques with traditional statistical
models to estimate causal effects while providing valid statistical
uncertainty measures for these estimates.

TMLE operates through a two-step process involving both the outcome and
treatment (exposure) models. Initially, it employs machine learning
algorithms to flexibly model the relationship between treatments,
covariates, and outcomes. This flexibility allows TMLE to account for
complex, high-dimensional covariate spaces without imposing restrictive
model assumptions. The outcome of this step is a set of initial
estimates for these relationships.

The second step of TMLE involves ``targeting'' these initial estimates
by incorporating information about the observed data distribution to
improve the accuracy of the causal effect estimate. This is achieved
through an iterative updating process, which adjusts the initial
estimates towards the true causal effect. This updating process is
guided by the efficient influence function, ensuring that the final TMLE
estimate is as close as possible, given the measures and data to the
true causal effect, while still being robust to model misspecification
in either the outcome model or the treatment model.

Again, a central feature of TMLE is its double-robustness property. This
means that if either the model for the treatment or the outcome is
correctly specified, the TMLE estimator will still consistently estimate
the causal effect. Additionally, TMLE uses cross-validation to avoid
over-fitting and ensure that the estimator performs well in finite
samples. Each step contributes to a robust methodology for examining the
\emph{causal} effects of interventions on outcomes. The marriage of TMLE
and machine learning technologies reduces the dependence on restrictive
modelling assumptions and introduces an additional layer of robustness.
For further details see (\citeproc{ref-duxedaz2021}{Díaz \emph{et al.}
2021}; \citeproc{ref-hoffman2022}{Hoffman \emph{et al.} 2022},
\citeproc{ref-hoffman2023}{2023}). We performed estimation using the
\texttt{lmtp} package (\citeproc{ref-williams2021}{Williams and Díaz
2021}). We used the \texttt{superlearner} library for non-parametric
estimation with the predefined libraries \texttt{SL.ranger},
\texttt{SL.glmnet}, and \texttt{SL.xboost}. Graphs, tables and output
reports were created using the \texttt{margot} package
(\citeproc{ref-margot2024}{Bulbulia 2024b}). All analysis methods follow
pre-stated protocols in Bulbulia
(\citeproc{ref-bulbulia2024PRACTICAL}{2024a}).

\subsubsection{Scope of Interventions}\label{scope-of-interventions}

To better understand the scope of the interventions to be contrasted, we
recommend presenting histograms showing treatment instances. The
following presents responses from baseline + 1 wave.

The All-GAIN intervention \(d(A=a^*)\) intervention is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-0up}

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\includegraphics{v5-man-lmtp-ow-coop-church_files/figure-pdf/fig-0up-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-0up}Figure shows a histogram of responses to
religious service frequency in the baseline + 1 wave. Responses above
eight were assigned to eight and values were rounded to the nearest
whole number. The red dashed line shows the population average. All
responses in the gold bars are shifted to four on the ALL-GAIN
intervention. All those responses in grey (four and above) remain
unchanged}

\end{figure}%

Notably, the ALL-GAIN intervention requires shifting a considerable mass
of the sample population. However, it does not require shifting those
who are attending religious service more frequently that four times per
month.

The All-LOSS intervention \(d(A=a^\prime)\) intervention is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-0down}

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\includegraphics{v5-man-lmtp-ow-coop-church_files/figure-pdf/fig-0down-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-0down}Figure shows a histogram of responses to
religious service frequency in the baseline + 1 wave. Responses above
eight were assigned to eight, and values were rounded to the nearest
whole number. The red dashed line shows the population average. All
responses in the blue bars are shifted to zero on the ALL-LOSS
intervention. All those responses in grey (zero) remain unchanged}

\end{figure}%

Notably, the ALL-LOSS intervention requires shifting a smaller
proportion of the sample population than the ALL-GAIN intervention.
Because religious service is declining in New Zealand, this intervention
holds more policy interest: the implications of loss are relevant to a
society where loss is occurring.

\subsubsection{Evidence for Change in the Treatment
Variable}\label{evidence-for-change-in-the-treatment-variable}

Table~\ref{tbl-transition} clarifies the change in the treatment
variable from the baseline wave to the baseline + 1 wave across the
sample. Assessing change in a variable is essential for evaluating the
positivity assumption and for recovering evidence for the
incidence-effect of the treatment variable {[}{]}.

\caption{This transition matrix captures shifts in states across two
waves---baseline and treatment---for individuals under study. Each cell
in the matrix represents the count of individuals transitioning from one
state to another. The rows correspond to the state at baseline (From),
and the columns correspond to the state at the treatment wave (To).
\textbf{Diagonal entries} (in \textbf{bold}): these signify the number
of individuals who remained in their initial state across both waves.
\textbf{Off-diagonal entries}: these signify the transitions of
individuals from their baseline state to a different state in the
treatment wave. A higher number on the diagonal relative to the
off-diagonal entries in the same row indicates greater stability in a
state. Conversely, higher off-diagonal numbers suggest more significant
shifts from the baseline state to other
states.}\label{tbl-transition}\tabularnewline

\textbf{?@tbl-tbl-transition} presents state change between the first
and second wave in religious service frequency. We find that state 4
(weekly attendance) and state 0 present the highest overall. However, we
also find that movement between these states, revealing they are not
deterministic. States 1, 2, 3, and 5 indicate relatively frequent
movement in and out of these states, suggesting lower stability in these
conditions.

\textbf{evidence for causality}.

For the outcome `friends gives money', the estimate is 0.837
{[}0.784,0.894{]}. The E-value for this effect estimate is 1.677, with a
lower bound of 1.483. In this scenario, assuming all modelled
covariates, an unmeasured confounder that exhibits an association with
both the treatment and outcome with a minimum strength (on the risk
ratio scale) of 1.483 could nullify the observed effect. However, the
effect would survive weaker unmeasured confounding. Here, we find
\textbf{evidence for causality}.

For the outcome `community gives money', the estimate is 0.767
{[}0.672,0.875{]}. The E-value for this effect estimate is 1.933 with a
lower bound of 1.547. In this scenario, assuming all modelled
covariates, an unmeasured confounder that exhibits an association with
both the treatment and outcome with a minimum strength (on the risk
ratio scale) of 1.547 could nullify the observed effect. However, the
effect would survive weaker unmeasured confounding. Here, we find
\textbf{evidence for causality}.

\subsection{Discussion}\label{discussion}

\subsubsection{Summary of findings}\label{summary-of-findings}

First, as expected, we observed that in theoretically relevant contrast,
ALL GAIN vs ALL LOSS had stronger effects than the policy-motivated
contrast ALL GAIN vs STATUS QUO. For example, whereas the measure of
social support revealed a causal effect for the theoretical
intervention, the policy-relevant intervention was unreliable. This
result suggests caution when inferring policy decisions on the results
from theoretically-motivated interventions.

Second, compared with the STATUS QUO, different policy motivations arise
for gaining and losing religious service attendance. In the first place,
the confidence intervals around loss expectations were narrower because
the underlying shifts involved required less counterfactual projection
across the population.

Third, we find corroborating evidence for the effects of religious
service attendance on charitable donations, measured by self-report data
and help-received responses. Presumably, much of this giving is to
religious institutions. Additional support for charitable giving comes
from public records, which in New Zealand must be reported because
religious institutions are charities that must report their earnings and
expenses {[}{]}. Whatever one may think of churches, the evidence from
New Zealand suggests they are efficient charities {[}{]}.

Fourth, Daryl\ldots{}

\subsubsection{Economic value of regular religious
service}\label{economic-value-of-regular-religious-service}

We may use our results to compute the approximate economic value of
religious service attendance by comparing the sums of expected donations
across the New Zealand's adult population under the all-gain, all-loss,
and status quo.

We find that an increase in religious service attendance is expected to
result in an individual average donation rate of 1462.9974584,
Conversely, a decrease in religious service attendance is expected to an
average charitable donation rate of 774.3809842. The status quo is
expected to yield an average donation rate of 921.4155272. The number of
adult residents living in New Zealand in 2021 was
\ensuremath{3.989\times 10^{6}},\footnote{\url{https://www.stats.govt.nz/information-releases/national-population-estimates-at-30-june-2021}}
Multiplying this number by the estimated rates suggests the net gain to
charity of country-wide religious service attendance compared with the
status quo is \ensuremath{2.1603703\times 10^{9}}. By contrast the net
cost of a country-wide loss of regular religious service attendance on
charitable donations is: \ensuremath{-5.8652079\times 10^{8}}.

Putting these figures in context, the government of New Zealand's annual
budget in 2021 was \ensuremath{5.7976\times 10^{10}}.\footnote{\url{https://www.treasury.govt.nz/publications/budgets/budget-2021}}.
The expected gain from the country-wide adoption of religious service is
0.0372632 of New Zealand's annual government budget in 2021 The expected
loss from the country-wide loss of all religious service amounts to
0.0101166 of New Zealand's annual government budget in 2021.

We infer that the declining religious service in New Zealand affects
charitable giving, however these costs sum to about 0.27 the opportunity
cost of hypothetical New Zealand in which the population attended
religious service regularly.

\subsubsection{Note of concern about the use of cross-sectional
regression models to investigate the social consequences of
religion}\label{note-of-concern-about-the-use-of-cross-sectional-regression-models-to-investigate-the-social-consequences-of-religion}

How do these results compare to cross-sectional regression?

We performed a cross-sectional analysis in which we estimated the
relationship between religious service attendance and charitable
donations. We included all regression covariates from the causal models
(including sample weights), except the baseline outcome. The coefficient
for religious service attendance in this model, which represents the
change in expectation from a one-unit change in the predictor, is b =
438; (95\% CI 406, 470). To obtain the monthly rate we multiplied this
estimate by 4.2 to obtain a prediction of 1839.6784467. This amount is
2.67 than we infer from the ALL-GAIN vs ALL LOSS causal model.

Recalled we did not find reliable evidence for self-reported
volunteering from gains in religious service attendance. However, the
coefficients we obtained for volunteering in a cross-sectional model
were estimated to be reliable at b = 0.34; (95\% CI 0.31, 0.36). To
obtain the monthly rate we multiplied this estimate by 4.2 and by 60 to
obtain a prediction of 84.7826593 minutes. This amount is 3.82 than we
infer from the ALL-GAIN vs ALL LOSS causal model.

The results underscore the importance of remembering that
cross-sectional regressions are unreliable for estimating causal
effects.

\subsubsection{Assumptions and
limitations}\label{assumptions-and-limitations}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Causality and confounding}: we employ rigorous causal
  inference techniques, but these are contingent on the assumption of no
  unmeasured confounding. Although our sensitivity analyses allow us to
  describe the amount of unmeasured confounding needed to explain away
  our results, it is unclear whether such confounders are present and,
  if so, how strongly they may be related to the treatments and
  outcomes. (to say more\ldots)
\item
  \textbf{Treatment effect heterogeneity}: even if we assume that the
  results are independent of the variations in treatments observed,
  because ``religious service attendance'' is not homogenous, we cannot
  give a precise interpretation of the results. Future work should
  investigate heterogeneity in treatment effects reported here.
\item
  \textbf{Measurement error}: Direct and/or correlated measurement
  errors may lead to bias by implying true effects in their absence.
  Additionally, uncorrelated measurement errors may lead to bias by
  attenuating true results in their presence. To some extent, our method
  for evaluating causation across multiple measures of ``prosociality''
  addresses these threats. However, variability in results may arise
  from presently unknown combinations of measurement error\ldots. (say
  more)
\item
  \textbf{Generalisability and transportability}: our findings should be
  interpreted within the context of the New Zealand population from
  which the data were sourced and weighted. Although these results may
  have broader relevance to similar populations, we advise against
  direct extrapolation to different populations or sociocultural
  settings.

age?'' or ``What is your date of birth'').

\paragraph{Charitable Donations (Study 1
outcome)}\label{charitable-donations-study-1-outcome}

Using one item from Hoverd and Sibley
(\citeproc{ref-hoverd_religious_2010}{2010}), we asked participants
``How much money have you donated to charity in the last year?''.

al.} (\citeproc{ref-sibley2011}{2011}): ``Hours spent \ldots{}
voluntary/charitable work.''

\paragraph{Community: Sense of Community (Study 2
outcome)}\label{community-sense-of-community-study-2-outcome}

We measured a sense of community with a single item from Sengupta
\emph{et al.} (\citeproc{ref-sengupta2013}{2013}): ``I feel a sense of
community with others in my local neighbourhood.'' Participants answered
on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).

\paragraph{Community: Felt Belongingness (Study 2
outcome)}\label{community-felt-belongingness-study-2-outcome}

We assessed felt belongingness with three items adapted from the Sense
of Belonging Instrument (\citeproc{ref-hagerty1995}{Hagerty and Patusky
1995}): (1) ``Know that people in my life accept and value me''; (2)
``Feel like an outsider''; (3) ``Know that people around me share my
attitudes and beliefs''. Participants responded on a scale from 1 (Very
Inaccurate) to 7 (Very Accurate). The second item was reversely coded.

\paragraph{Community: Social Support (Study 2
outcome)}\label{community-social-support-study-2-outcome}

Participants' perceived social support was measured using three items
from Cutrona and Russell (\citeproc{ref-cutrona1987}{1987}) and Williams
\emph{et al.} (\citeproc{ref-williams_cyberostracism_2000}{2000}): (1)
``There are people I can depend on to help me if I really need it''; (2)
``There is no one I can turn to for guidance in times of stress''; (3)
``I know there are people I can turn to when I need help.'' Participants
indicated the extent to which they agreed with those items (1 = Strongly
Disagree to 7 = Strongly Agree). The second item was negatively worded,
so we reversely recorded the responses to this item.

\paragraph{Disability}\label{disability}

We assessed disability with a one item indicator adapted from Verbrugge
(\citeproc{ref-verbrugge1997}{1997}), that asks ``Do you have a health
condition or disability that limits you, and that has lasted for 6+
months?'' (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

\paragraph{Education Attainment (waves: 1,
4-15)}\label{education-attainment-waves-1-4-15}

We asked participants, ``What is your highest level of qualification?''.
We coded participants' highest finished degree according to the New
Zealand Qualifications Authority. Ordinal-Rank 0-10 NZREG codes (with
overseas school quals coded as Level 3, and all other ancillary
categories coded as missing)
See:https://www.nzqa.govt.nz/assets/Studying-in-NZ/New-Zealand-Qualification-Framework/requirements-nzqf.pdf

\paragraph{Employment (waves: 1-3,
4-11)}\label{employment-waves-1-3-4-11}

We asked participants, ``Are you currently employed? (This includes
self-employed or casual work)''. * note: This question disappeared in
the updated NZAVS Technical documents (Data Dictionary).

\paragraph{Ethnicity}\label{ethnicity}

Based on the New Zealand Census, we asked participants, ``Which ethnic
group(s) do you belong to?''. The responses were: (1) New Zealand
European; (2) Māori; (3) Samoan; (4) Cook Island Māori; (5) Tongan; (6)
Niuean; (7) Chinese; (8) Indian; (9) Other such as DUTCH, JAPANESE,
TOKELAUAN. Please state:. We coded their answers into four groups:
Maori, Pacific, Asian, and Euro (except for Time 3, which used an
open-ended measure).

\paragraph{Fatigue}\label{fatigue}

We assessed subjective fatigue by asking participants, ``During the last
30 days, how often did \ldots{} you feel exhausted?'' Responses were
collected on an ordinal scale (0 = None of The Time, 1 = A little of The
Time, 2 = Some of The Time, 3 = Most of The Time, 4 = All of The Time).

\paragraph{Gender (waves: 1-15)}\label{gender-waves-1-15}

We asked participants' gender in an open-ended question: ``what is your
gender?'' or ``Are you male or female?'' (waves: 1-5). Female was coded
as 0, Male was coded as 1, and gender diverse coded as 3
(\citeproc{ref-fraser_coding_2020}{Fraser \emph{et al.} 2020}). (or 0.5
= neither female nor male)

Here, we coded all those who responded as Male as 1, and those who did
not as 0.

\paragraph{Honesty-Humility-Modesty Facet (waves:
10-14)}\label{honesty-humility-modesty-facet-waves-10-14}

Participants indicated the extent to which they agree with the following
four statements from Campbell \emph{et al.}
(\citeproc{ref-campbell2004}{2004}) , and Sibley \emph{et al.}
(\citeproc{ref-sibley2011}{2011}) (1 = Strongly Disagree to 7 = Strongly
Agree)

\begin{verbatim}
i.  I want people to know that I am an important person of high status, (Waves: 1, 10-14)
ii. I am an ordinary person who is no better than others.
iii. I wouldn't want people to treat me as though I were superior to them.
iv. I think that I am entitled to more respect than the average person is.
\end{verbatim}

``Do you have siblings?'' (\citeproc{ref-stronge2019onlychild}{Stronge
\emph{et al.} 2019})

\paragraph{Hours of Childcare}\label{hours-of-childcare}

We measured hours of exercising using one item from Sibley \emph{et al.}
(\citeproc{ref-sibley2011}{2011}): 'Hours spent \ldots{} looking after
children.''

To stabilise this indicator, we took the natural log of the response +
1.

\paragraph{Hours of Housework}\label{hours-of-housework}

We measured hours of exercising using one item from Sibley \emph{et al.}
(\citeproc{ref-sibley2011}{2011}): ``Hours spent \ldots{}
housework/cooking''

To stabilise this indicator, we took the natural log of the response +
1.

\paragraph{Hours of Exercise}\label{hours-of-exercise}

We measured hours of exercising using one item from Sibley \emph{et al.}
(\citeproc{ref-sibley2011}{2011}): ``Hours spent \ldots{}
exercising/physical activity''

To stabilise this indicator, we took the natural log of the response +
1.

\paragraph{Hours of Childcare}\label{hours-of-childcare-1}

Participants were asked ``During the past month, on average, how many
hours of \emph{actual sleep} did you get per night''.

\paragraph{Socialising (time 10, time
11)}\label{socialising-time-10-time-11}

As part of the time usage measures, participants were asked to state how
many hour the spent in activities related to socialising with the
following groups:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Hours spent \ldots{} socialising with family
\item
  Hours spent \ldots{} socialising with friends
\item
  Hours spent \ldots{} socialising with community groups
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Hours of Work}\label{hours-of-work}

We measured hours of work using one item from Sibley \emph{et al.}
(\citeproc{ref-sibley2011}{2011}):``Hours spent \ldots{} working in paid
employment.''

To stabilise this indicator, we took the natural log of the response +
1.

\paragraph{Income (waves: 1-3, 4-15)}\label{income-waves-1-3-4-15}

Participants were asked ``Please estimate your total household income
(before tax) for the year XXXX''. To stabilise this indicator, we first
took the natural log of the response + 1, and then centred and
standardised the log-transformed indicator.

\paragraph{Living in an Urban Area (waves:
1-15)}\label{living-in-an-urban-area-waves-1-15}

We coded whether they are living in an urban or rural area (1 = Urban, 0
= Rural) based on the addresses provided.

We coded whether they were living in an urban or rural area (1 = Urban,
0 = Rural) based on the addresses provided.

\paragraph{Mini-IPIP 6 (waves:
1-3,4-15)}\label{mini-ipip-6-waves-1-34-15}

We measured participants' personalities with the Mini International
Personality Item Pool 6 (Mini-IPIP6) (\citeproc{ref-sibley2011}{Sibley
\emph{et al.} 2011}), which consists of six dimensions and each
dimension is measured with four items:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  agreeableness,

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\roman{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    I sympathize with others' feelings.
  \item
    I am not interested in other people's problems. (r)
  \item
    I feel others' emotions.
  \item
    I am not really interested in others. (r)
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  conscientiousness,

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\roman{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    I get chores done right away.
  \item
    I like order.
  \item
    I make a mess of things. (r)
  \item
    I often forget to put things back in their proper place. (r)
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  extraversion,

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\roman{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    I am the life of the party.
  \item

  \tightlist
  \item
    I feel entitled to more of everything. (r)

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\roman{enumii}.}
  \tightlist

  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

Each dimension was assessed with four items and participants rated the
accuracy of each item as it applies to them from 1 (Very Inaccurate) to
7 (Very Accurate). Items marked with (r) are reverse coded.

\paragraph{NZ-Born (waves: 1-2,4-15)}\label{nz-born-waves-1-24-15}

We asked participants, ``Which country were you born in?'' or ``Where
were you born? (please be specific, e.g., which town/city?)'' (waves:
6-15).

\paragraph{NZ Deprivation Index (waves:
1-15)}\label{nz-deprivation-index-waves-1-15}

We used the NZ Deprivation Index to assign each participant a score
based on where they live (\citeproc{ref-atkinson2019}{Atkinson \emph{et
al.} 2019}). This score combines data such as income, home ownership,
employment, qualifications, family structure, housing, and access to
transport and communication for an area into one deprivation score.

\paragraph{Opt-in}\label{opt-in}

The New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study allows opt-ins to the study.
Because the opt-in population may differ from those sampled randomly
from the New Zealand electoral roll; although the opt-in rate is low, we
include an indicator (yes/no) for this variable.

\paragraph{NZSEI Occupational Prestige and Status (waves:
8-15)}\label{nzsei-occupational-prestige-and-status-waves-8-15}

We assessed occupational prestige and status using the New Zealand
Socio-economic Index 13 (NZSEI-13) (\citeproc{ref-fahy2017a}{Fahy
\emph{et al.} 2017a}). This index uses the income, age, and education of
a reference group, in this case the 2013 New Zealand census, to
calculate a score for each occupational group. Scores range from 10
(Lowest) to 90 (Highest). This list of index scores for occupational
groups was used to assign each participant a NZSEI-13 score based on
their occupation.

We assessed occupational prestige and status using the New Zealand
Socio-economic Index 13 (NZSEI-13) (\citeproc{ref-fahy2017}{Fahy
\emph{et al.} 2017b}). This index uses the income, age, and education of
a reference group, in this case, the 2013 New Zealand census, to
calculate a score for each occupational group. Scores range from 10
(Lowest) to 90 (Highest). This list of index scores for occupational
groups was used to assign each participant a NZSEI-13 score based on
their occupation.

\paragraph{Number of Children (waves: 1-3,
4-15)}\label{number-of-children-waves-1-3-4-15}

We measured the number of children using one item from Bulbulia
(\citeproc{ref-Bulbulia_2015}{2015}). We asked participants, ``How many
children have you given birth to, fathered, or adopted. How many
children have you given birth to, fathered, or adopted?'' or ````How
many children have you given birth to, fathered, or adopted. How many
children have you given birth to, fathered, and/or parented?'' (waves:
12-15).

\paragraph{Partner: Has}\label{partner-has}

``What is your relationship status?'' (e.g., single, married, de-facto,
civil union, widowed, living together, etc.)

\paragraph{Politically Conservative}\label{politically-conservative}

We measured participants' political conservative orientation using a
single item adapted from Jost (\citeproc{ref-jost_end_2006-1}{2006}).

``Please rate how politically liberal versus conservative you see
yourself as being.''

(1 = Extremely Liberal to 7 = Extremely Conservative)

\paragraph{Politically Right Wing}\label{politically-right-wing}

We measured participants' political right-wing orientation using a
single item adapted from Jost (\citeproc{ref-jost_end_2006-1}{2006}).

``Please rate how politically left-wing versus right-wing you see
yourself as being..''

(1 = Extremely left-wing to 7 = Extremely right-wing)

\paragraph{Short-Form Health}\label{short-form-health}

Participants' subjective health was measured using one item (``Do you
have a health condition or disability that limits you, and that has
lasted for 6+ months?''; 1 = Yes, 0 = No) adapted from Verbrugge
(\citeproc{ref-verbrugge1997}{1997}).

\paragraph{Support received: money (waves 10-13) (Study 4
outcomes)}\label{support-received-money-waves-10-13-study-4-outcomes}

The NZAVS has a `revealed' measure of received help and support measured
in hours of support in the previous week. The items are:

Received help and support - money - family - friends - others in my
community

\paragraph{Support received: time (waves 10-13) (Study 3
outcomes)}\label{support-received-time-waves-10-13-study-3-outcomes}

The NZAVS has a `revealed' measure of received help and support measured
in hours of support in the previous week. The items are:

Received help and support - hours - family - friends - others in my
community

\paragraph{Total Siblings}\label{total-siblings}

Participants were asked the following questions related to sibling
counts:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Were you the 1st born, 2nd born, or 3rd born, etc, child of your
  mother?
\item
  Do you have siblings?
\item
  How many older sisters do you have?
\item
  How many younger sisters do you have?
\item
  How many older brothers do you have?
\item
  How many younger brothers do you have?
\end{itemize}

A single score was obtained from sibling counts by summing responses to
the ``How many\ldots{}'' items. From these scores an ordered factor was
created ranging from 0 to 7, where participants with more than 7
siblings were grouped into the highest category.

Table~\ref{tbl-table-exposures} presents baseline (NZAVS time 10) and
exposure wave (NZAVS time 11) statistics for the exposure variable:
religious service attendance (range 0-8). Responses coded as eight or
above were coded as ``8''. This decision to avoid spare treatments was
based on theoretical grounds, namely, that daily exposure would be
similar in its effects to more than daily exposure. We note that causal
contrasts were obtained for projects at either no attendance or
four-or-more visits per month. Hence this simplification of the measure
is unlikely to affect theoretical and practical inferences. Because the
treatment wave (NZAVS time 11) occurred in New Zealand's COVID-19
pandemic, all models adjusted for the pandemic alert-level. The pandemic
is not a ``confounder'' because a confounder must be related to the
treatment and the outcome. At the end of the study, all participants had
been exposed to the pandemic. However, to satisfy the causal consistency
assumption, all treatments must be conditionally equivalent within
levels of all covariates (\citeproc{ref-vanderweele2013}{VanderWeele and
Hernan 2013}). Because COVID affected the ability or willingness of
individuals to attend religious service, we included the lockdown
condition as a covariate (\citeproc{ref-sibley2012a}{Sibley and Bulbulia
2012}). To better enable conditional independence within levels of the
treatment variable, we conditioned on the lead value of COVID-alert
level at baseline. To mitigate systematic biases arising from attrition,
and missingness, the \texttt{lmtp} package uses inverse probability of
censoring weights, which were used when estimating the causal effects of
the exposure on the outcome.

\subsubsection{Binary Transition Table for The
Treatment}\label{binary-transition-table-for-the-treatment}

The table presents a transition matrix to evaluate treatment shifts
between baseline and treatment wave. Here we focus on the shift from/to
monthly attendance at four or more visits per month. Entries along the
diagonal (in bold) indicate the number of individuals who
\textbf{stayed} in their initial state. By contrast, the off-diagonal
shows the transitions from the initial state (bold) to another state in
the following wave (off diagonal). Thus the cell located at the
intersection of row \(i\) and column \(j\), where \(i \neq j\), gives us
the counts of individuals moving from state \(i\) to state \(j\).

\subsubsection{Imbalance of Confounding Covariates

Figure~\ref{fig-match_1} shows imbalance of covariates on the treatment

\end{figure}%

Figure~\ref{fig-match_2} shows imbalance of covariates on the treatment
at the second exposure. Note that church attendance at the first wave
shows the strongest relationship with church attendance at the second
wave. At both waves, the \texttt{lmtp} automatically adjusts for all
covariates, including the exposure at the previous wave. At both waves
the natural value of the exposure is used to estimate the policy-level
of the exposure.
