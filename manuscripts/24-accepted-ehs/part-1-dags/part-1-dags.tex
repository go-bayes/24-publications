Causal inference requires contrasting counterfactual states of the world
under pre-specified interventions. Obtaining counterfactual contrasts
from data relies on explicit assumptions and careful, multi-step
workflows. Causal diagrams are powerful tools for clarifying whether and
how the counterfactual contrasts we seek can be identified from data.
Here, I explain how to use causal directed acyclic graphs (causal DAGs)
to determine whether and how causal effects can be identified from
`real-world' non-experimental observational data. I offer practical tips
for reporting and suggest ways to avoid common pitfalls.

\subsection{Introduction}\label{id-sec-introduction}

Human research begins with two fundamental questions:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  What do I want to know?
\item
  For which population does this knowledge generalise?
\end{enumerate}

In the human sciences, our questions are typically causal. We aim to
understand the effects of interventions on certain variables. However,
many researchers report non-causal associations, collecting data,
applying complex regressions, and reporting coefficients. We often speak
of covariates as `predicting' outcomes. Yet, even when our models
predict well, it remains unclear how these predictions relate to the
scientific questions that sparked our interest. Our predictions lack
meaning and fail to address our core scientific questions.

Some say that association cannot imply causation. However, our
experimental traditions reveal that when interventions are controlled
and randomised, the coefficients we recover from statistical models can
permit causal interpretations.

Despite familiarity with experimental protocols, many researchers
struggle to emulate randomisation and control with non-experimental or
`real-world' data. Though we use terms such as `control' and employ
sophisticated adjustment strategies, such as multilevel modelling and
structural equation models, our practices are not systematic. We often
overlook that what we take as control can undermine our ability to
consistently estimate causal effects
(\citeproc{ref-montgomery2018}{Montgomery et al., 2018}). Although the
term `crisis' is overused, the state of causal inference across many
human sciences, including experimental sciences, has much headroom for
improvement. `Room for headroom' applies to poor experimental designs
that unintentionally weaken causal claims
(\citeproc{ref-bulbulia_2024_experiments}{Bulbulia, 2024e};
\citeproc{ref-hernan2017per}{Hernán et al., 2017};
\citeproc{ref-montgomery2018}{Montgomery et al., 2018}). Fortunately,
recent decades have seen considerable progress in causal data science,
commonly called `causal inference', or `CI'. The progress has
transformed those areas of health science, economics, political science,
and computer science that have adopted it. Causal inference provides
methods for obtaining valid causal inferences from data through careful,
systematic workflows.

Within the workflows of causal inference, causal directed acyclic graphs
(causal DAGs)---are powerful tools for evaluating whether and how causal
effects can be identified from data. My purpose here is to explain where
these tools fit within causal inference workflows and to illustrate
several practical applications. I focus on causal directed acyclic
graphs (causal DAGs) because they are relatively easy to use and clear
for most applications. However, causal DAGs can be misused. I will
consider common pitfalls and how to avoid them.

In \hyperref[id-sec-1]{Part 1}, I review the conceptual foundations of
causal inference. The basis of all causal inference lies in
counterfactual contrasts. Although there are slightly different
philosophical approaches to counterfactual reasoning, it is widely
agreed that to infer a causal effect is to contrast counterfactual for a
well defined population under different levels of intervention. The
overview I present here builds on the Neyman-Rubin potential outcomes
framework of causal inference (\citeproc{ref-holland1986}{Holland,
1986}) as it has been extended for longitudinal treatments by
epidemiologist James Robins (\citeproc{ref-robins1986}{J. Robins,
1986}).

In \hyperref[id-sec-2]{Part 2}, I describe how causal directed acyclic
graphs (causal DAGs) allow investigators to evaluate whether and how
causal effects may be identified from data using assumptions encoded in
a causal DAG. I outline five elementary graphical structures from which
all causal relations may be derived; these structures form the building
blocks of every causal directed acyclic graphs. I then examine five
rules that clarify whether and how investigators may identify causal
effects from data under the structural (or equivalently causal)
assumptions that a causal DAG encodes.

In \hyperref[id-sec-3]{Part 3}, I apply causal directed acyclic graphs
to seven common identification problems, showing how repeated-measures
data collection addresses these problems. I then use causal diagrams to
explain the limitations of repeated-measures data collection for
identifying causal effects, tempering enthusiasm for easy solutions from
repeated-measures designs.

In \hyperref[id-sec-4]{Part 4}, I offer practical suggestions for
creating and reporting causal directed acyclic graphs in scientific
research. Where there is ambiguity or debate about how a treatment may
be related to an outcome independently of causality, I suggest that
investigators report multiple causal diagrams and conduct distinct
analyses for each.

\subsection{Part 1: Causal Inference as Counterfactual Data
Science}\label{id-sec-1}

The first step in answering a causal question is to ask it
(\citeproc{ref-hernuxe1n2016}{Hernán et al., 2016a}).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  What causal quantity do I want to learn from the data?
\item
  For which population does this knowledge generalise?
\end{enumerate}

Causal diagrams come after we have stated a causal question and have
clarified the population for whom we hope to obtain valid causal
inferences -- the `target population'. We begin by considering what is
required to state a causal question and to define a target population
precisely.

\subsubsection{The Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference: Missing
Counterfactual
Observations}\label{the-fundamental-problem-of-causal-inference-missing-counterfactual-observations}

To ask a causal question, we must consider the concept of causality
itself. Consider an intervention, \(A\), and its effect, \(Y\). We say
that \(A\) causes \(Y\) if altering \(A\) would lead to a change in
\(Y\) (\citeproc{ref-hume1902}{Hume, 1902};
\citeproc{ref-lewis1973}{Lewis, 1973}). If altering \(A\) would not
change \(Y\), we say that \(A\) has no causal effect on \(Y\).

In causal inference, we aim to use data to quantitatively contrast the
potential outcomes in response to different levels of a well-defined
intervention. Commonly, we refer to such interventions as `exposures' or
`treatments;' we refer to the possible effects of interventions as
`potential outcomes.'

Consider a binary treatment variable \(A \in \{0,1\}\). For each unit
\(i\) in the set \(\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}\), when \(A_i\) is set to 0, the
potential outcome under this condition is denoted \(Y_i(0)\).
Conversely, when \(A_i\) is set to 1, the potential outcome is denoted
\(Y_i(1)\). We refer to the terms \(Y_i(1)\) and \(Y_i(0)\) as
`potential outcomes' because, until realised, the effects of
interventions describe counterfactual states.

Suppose that each unit \(i\) receives either \(A_i = 1\) or \(A_i = 0\).
The corresponding outcomes are realised as \(Y_i|A_i = 1\) or
\(Y_i|A_i = 0\). For now, we assume that each realised outcome under
that intervention is equivalent to one of the potential outcomes
required for a quantitative causal contrast, such that
\([(Y_i(a)|A_i = a)] = (Y_i|A_i = a)\). Thus, when \(A_i = 1\),
\(Y_i(1)|A_i = 1\) is observed. However, when \(A_i = 1\), it follows
that \(Y_i(0)|A_i = 1\) is not observed:

\[
Y_i|A_i = 1 \implies Y_i(0)|A_i = 1~ \text{is counterfactual}
\]

Conversely:

\[
Y_i|A_i = 0 \implies Y_i(1)|A_i = 0~ \text{is counterfactual}
\]

We define \(\delta_i\) as the individual causal effect for unit \(i\)
and express the individual causal effect as:

\[
\delta_i = Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)
\]

Notice that at the level of the individual, a causal effect is a
contrast between treatments one of which is excluded by the other at any
given time. That individual causal effects cannot be identified from
observations is known as `\emph{the fundamental problem of causal
inference}' (\citeproc{ref-holland1986}{Holland, 1986};
\citeproc{ref-rubin1976}{Rubin, 1976}).

\subsubsection{Identifying Causal Effects Using Randomised
Experiments}\label{identifying-causal-effects-using-randomised-experiments}

Although it is not typically feasible to compute individual causal
effects, under certain assumptions, it may be possible to estimate
\emph{average} treatment effects, also called `marginal effects' by
contrasting the outcomes of observed treatments among individuals who
have been randomly assigned, perhaps conditional on measured covariates,
to the treatment levels that investigators wish to compare. We define an
average treatment effect (ATE) as the difference between the expected or
average outcomes observed under treatment where treatment has been
randomly assigned, perhaps conditionally, on measured covariates.
Consider a binary treatment, \(A \in \{0,1\}\). We write the average
treatment effect as a contrast in the expected means of a population all
of whose members are exposed to two levels of treatment:

\[
\text{Average Treatment Effect} = \mathbb{E}[Y(1)] - \mathbb{E}[Y(0)]
\]

This is our pre-specified estimand for our target population. Note that
a challenge remains in computing these treatment-group averages, given
that individual causal effects are unobservable: each treatment to be
compared is not administered to every member of the population from
which a sample is drawn. We can frame the problem by referring to the
\emph{full data} required to compute this estimand --- that is, in terms
of the complete counterfactual dataset where the missing potential
outcomes, inherent in observational data, were somehow available for
everyone in the target population. The text highlighted in red denotes
inherently missing responses over the joint distribution of the full
counterfactual dataset. Suppose that 50\% of the sample is randomly
assigned to each treatment condition. We find that for each treatment
condition, half the observations over the joint distribution of the
counterfactual data are inherently unobservable:

\[
\text{Average Treatment Effect} = \left(\underbrace{\underbrace{\mathbb{E}[Y(1)|A = 1]}_{\text{observed for } A = 1} + \underbrace{\textcolor{red}{\mathbb{E}[Y(1)|A = 0]}}_{\textcolor{red}{\text{unobserved for } A = 0}}}_{\text{effect among treated}}\right) - \left(\underbrace{\underbrace{\mathbb{E}[Y(0)|A = 0]}_{\text{observed for } A = 0} + \underbrace{\textcolor{red}{\mathbb{E}[Y(0)|A = 1]}}_{\textcolor{red}{\text{unobserved for } A = 1}}}_{\text{effect among untreated}}\right)
\]

Although the fundamental problem of causal inference remains at the
individual level, randomisation allows investigators to recover the
treatment group averages. When investigators randomise units into
treatment conditions, ensuring full adherence and a sufficiently large
sample to rule out chance differences in group composition, we can
generally attribute differences in treatment group averages to the
treatment itself. That is, randomisation implies:

\[
\mathbb{E}[Y(0) | A = 1] = \mathbb{E}[Y(0) | A = 0]
\]

and

\[
\mathbb{E}[Y(1) | A = 1] = \mathbb{E}[Y(1) | A = 0]
\]

If we assume:

\[ 
\mathbb{E}[Y(1) | A = 1] = \mathbb{E}[Y | A = 1]
\]

and

\[
\mathbb{E}[Y(0) | A = 0] = \mathbb{E}[Y | A = 0]
\]

it follows that the average treatment effect of a randomised experiment
can be computed:

\[
\text{Average Treatment Effect} = \widehat{\mathbb{E}}[Y | A = 1] - \widehat{\mathbb{E}}[Y | A = 0]
\]

It is evident that we do not require the joint distribution over the
full data (i.e., the counterfactual data) to obtain these averages.
Rather, randomisation allows us to obtain a contrast of averages (or
equivalently the average of contrasts) from the observed data.

There are four critical aspects of how ideally randomised experiments
enable the estimation of average treatment effects worth highlighting.

First, we must specify a population for whom they seek to generalise
their results. We refer to this population as the \emph{target
population}. If the study population differs from the target population
in the distribution of covariates that interact with the treatment, we
will have no guarantees our results will generalise (for discussions of
sample/target population mismatch, refer to Imai et al.
(\citeproc{ref-imai2008misunderstandings}{2008}); Westreich et al.
(\citeproc{ref-westreich2019target}{2019}); Westreich et al.
(\citeproc{ref-westreich2017}{2017}); Pearl \& Bareinboim
(\citeproc{ref-pearl2022}{2022}); Bareinboim \& Pearl
(\citeproc{ref-bareinboim2013general}{2013}); Stuart et al.
(\citeproc{ref-stuart2018generalizability}{2018}); Webster-Clark \&
Breskin (\citeproc{ref-webster2021directed}{2021})).

Second, because the units in the study sample at randomisation may
differ from the units in the study after randomisation, we must be
careful to avoid biases that arise from sample/population mismatch over
time (\citeproc{ref-bulbulia2024wierd}{Bulbulia, 2024d};
\citeproc{ref-hernan2004STRUCTURAL}{Hernán et al., 2004}). If there is
sample attrition or non-response, the treatment effect we obtain for the
sample may differ from the treatment effect in the target population.

Third, a randomised experiment recovers the causal effect of random
treatment assignment, not of the treatment itself, which may differ if
some participants do not adhere to their treatment (even if they remain
in the study) (\citeproc{ref-hernan2017per}{Hernán et al., 2017}). The
effect of randomised assignment is called the `intent-to-treat effect'
or equivalently the `intention-to-treat effect'. The effect of perfect
adherence is called the `per-protocol effect'
(\citeproc{ref-hernan2017per}{Hernán et al., 2017};
\citeproc{ref-lash2020}{Lash et al., 2020}). To obtain the per-protocol
effect for randomised experiments, methods for causal inference in
observational settings must be applied
(\citeproc{ref-bulbulia_2024_experiments}{Bulbulia, 2024e};
\citeproc{ref-hernan2017per}{Hernán et al., 2017}).

Fourth, I have presented the average treatment effect on the additive
scale, that is, as an additive difference in average potential outcomes
for the target population under two distinct levels of treatment.
However, depending on the scientific question at hand, investigators may
wish to estimate causal effects on the risk-ratio scale, the rate-ratio
scale, the hazard-ratio scale, or another scale. Where there are
interactions such that treatment effects vary across different strata of
the population, an estimate of the causal effect on the risk difference
scale will differ in at least one stratum to be compared from the
estimate on the risk ratio scale
(\citeproc{ref-greenland2003quantifying}{Greenland, 2003};
\citeproc{ref-vanderweele2012}{VanderWeele, 2012}). The sensitivity of
treatment effects in the presence of interactions to the scale of
contrast underscores the importance of pre-specifying a scale for the
causal contrast investigators hope to obtain.

Fifth, investigators may unintentionally spoil randomisation by
adjusting for indicators that might be affected by the treatment,
outcome, or both, by excluding participants using attention checks, by
collecting covariate data that might be affected by the experimental
conditions, by failing to account for non-response and
loss-to-follow-up, and by committing any number of other self-inflicted
injuries (\citeproc{ref-bulbulia_2024_experiments}{Bulbulia, 2024e}).
Unfortunately, such practices of self-inflicted confounding are
widespread (\citeproc{ref-montgomery2018}{Montgomery et al., 2018}).
Notably, causal directed acyclic graphs are useful for describing risks
to valid causal identification in experiments (refer to Hernán et al.
(\citeproc{ref-hernan2017per}{2017})), a topic I consider elsewhere
(\citeproc{ref-bulbulia_2024_experiments}{Bulbulia, 2024e}).

In observational studies, investigators might wish to describe the
target population of interest as a restriction of the study sample
population. For example, investigators might wish to estimate the
average treatment effect only in the population that received the
treatment (\citeproc{ref-greifer2023}{Greifer et al., 2023};
\citeproc{ref-greifer2023a}{Greifer, 2023}). This treatment effect is
sometimes called the average treatment effect in the treated (ATT) and
may be expressed as:

\[
\text{Average Treatment Effect in the Treated} = \mathbb{E}[Y(1) - Y(0) \mid A = 1]
\]

Consider that if investigators are interested in the average treatment
effect in the treated, counterfactual comparisons are deliberately
restricted to the sample population that was treated. That is, the
investigators will seek to obtain the average of the missing
counterfactual outcomes for the treated population if everyone in that
population were, perhaps contrary to fact, treated, without necessarily
obtaining the counterfactual outcomes for the untreated population. This
difference in focus may imply different assumptions and analytic
workflows. Supplementary materials \textbf{S2} describes an example for
which the assumptions required to estimate the average treatment effect
in the treated might be preferred. In what follows, we will use the term
ATE as a placeholder to mean the average treatment effect, or
equivalently the `marginal effect', for a target population on a
pre-specified scale of causal contrast, where we assume that this effect
estimate pertains to the source population from which the analytic
sample was randomly drawn (under the assumption of random sampling,
which, as with most assumptions, need not hold
(\citeproc{ref-dahabreh2019generalizing}{Dahabreh et al., 2019};
\citeproc{ref-dahabreh2019}{Dahabreh \& Hernán, 2019}).

Setting aside the important detail that the `average treatment effect'
requires considerable care in its specification, it is worth pausing to
marvel at how an ideally conducted randomised controlled experiment
provides a means for identifying inherently unobservable
counterfactuals. It does so by using a Sherlock-Holmes method of
inference by elimination of confounders, which randomisation balances
across treatments.

When experimenters observe a difference in average treatment effects,
and all else goes right, they may infer that the distribution of
potential outcomes differs by treatment because randomisation exhausts
every other explanation. If the experiment is valid, experimenters are
entitled to this inference because randomisation balances the
distribution of potential confounders across the treatment groups to be
compared.

However, we lack guarantees for balance in the confounders outside
idealised randomised experiments. Unfortunately, randomised experiments
cannot address many scientifically important questions. This bitter
constraint is familiar to evolutionary human scientists. We typically
confront `What if?' questions that are rooted in the unidirectional
nature of human history. However, understanding how randomisation
obtains the missing counterfactual outcomes that we require to
consistently estimate average treatment effects clarifies the tasks of
causal inference in non-experimental settings
(\citeproc{ref-hernuxe1n2008a}{Hernán et al., 2008a};
\citeproc{ref-hernuxe1n2022}{Hernán et al., 2022};
\citeproc{ref-hernuxe1n2006}{Hernán \& Robins, 2006a}): we want to
ensure balance in the variables that might affect outcomes under
treatment in the treatment groups to be compared.

Next, we examine basic causal identification assumptions in greater
detail. We do so because using causal diagrams without understanding
these assumptions may lead to unwarranted false confidence.

\subsubsection{Fundamental Assumptions Required for Causal Inference in
the Potential Outcomes
Framework}\label{fundamental-assumptions-required-for-causal-inference-in-the-potential-outcomes-framework}

Three fundamental identification assumptions must be satisfied to
consistently estimate causal effects from data. These assumptions are
typically satisfied in properly executed randomised controlled trials
but not in real-world studies where randomised treatment assignment is
absent.

\paragraph{Assumption 1: Causal
Consistency}\label{assumption-1-causal-consistency}

We satisfy the causal consistency assumption when, for each unit \(i\)
in the set \(\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}\), the observed outcome corresponds to
one of the specific counterfactual outcomes to be compared such that:

\[
Y_i^{observed}|A_i = 
\begin{cases} 
Y_i(a^*) & \text{if } A_i = a^* \\
Y_i(a) & \text{if } A_i = a
\end{cases}
\]

The causal consistency assumption implies that the observed outcome at
the specific treatment level that an individual receives equates to that
individual's counterfactual outcome at the observed treatment level.
Although this assumption would appear straightforward, outside ideally
controlled randomised experiments, treatment conditions typically vary,
and treatment heterogeneity poses considerable challenges to satisfying
this assumption. Refer to supplementary materials \textbf{S3} for
further discussion on how investigators may satisfy the causal
consistency assumption in real-world settings.

\paragraph{Assumption 2: Positivity}\label{assumption-2-positivity}

We satisfy the positivity assumption if there is a non-zero probability
of receiving each treatment level within each stratum of covariate
required to ensure conditional exchangeability of treatments (assumption
3). Where \(A\) is the treatment and \(L\) is a vector of covariates
sufficient to ensure no unmeasured confounding, we say positivity is
achieved if:

\[
0 < Pr(A = a | L = l) < 1, \quad \text{for all } a, l \text{ with } Pr(L = l) > 0
\]

There are two types of positivity violation:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Random non-positivity}: When a treatment is theoretically
  possible but specific treatment levels are not represented in the
  data, random non-positivity is the only identifiability assumption
  verifiable with data.
\item
  \textbf{Deterministic non-positivity}: When the treatment is
  implausible by nature, such as a hysterectomy in biological males.
\end{enumerate}

Satisfying the positivity assumption can present considerable data
challenges (\citeproc{ref-bulbulia2023a}{Bulbulia et al., 2023};
\citeproc{ref-westreich2010}{Westreich \& Cole, 2010}). For instance, if
we wanted to estimate a one-year causal effect of weekly religious
service attendance on charitable donations, controlling for baseline
attendance, and the natural transition rate to weekly service attendance
is low, the effective sample size for the treatment condition may be
insufficient. Where the positivity assumption is violated, causal
diagrams will be of limited utility because observations in the data do
not support valid causal inferences. Supplementary materials \textbf{S2}
presents a worked example illustrating this difficulty in a cultural
evolutionary context.)

\paragraph{Assumption 3: Conditional Exchangeability (also `No
Unmeasured Confounding', `Conditional Ignorability',
`d-separation')}\label{assumption-3-conditional-exchangeability-also-no-unmeasured-confounding-conditional-ignorability-d-separation}

We satisfy the conditional exchangeability assumption if the treatment
groups are conditionally balanced in the variables that could affect the
potential outcomes. In experimental designs, random assignment
facilitates this assumption. In observational studies, more effort is
required to control for any covariate that could account for observed
correlations between \(A\) and \(Y\) without a causal effect of \(A\) on
\(Y\).

Let \(\coprod\) denote independence, and let \(L\) denote the set of
covariates necessary to ensure this conditional independence.
Conditional exchangeability is satisfied when:

\[
Y(a) \coprod A | L \quad \text{or equivalently} \quad A \coprod Y(a) | L
\]

If we assume that the positivity and consistency assumptions also hold,
we may compute the average treatment effect (ATE) on the difference
scale:

\[
\text{Average Treatment Effect} = \mathbb{E}[Y(1) | L] - \mathbb{E}[Y(0) | L]
\]

In randomised controlled experiments, exchangeability is unconditional.
We would only adjust our statistical model by interacting the treatment
with pre-treatment variables to improve efficiency
(\citeproc{ref-lin2012regressexperiments}{Lin, 2013}) or diminish
threats to valid randomisation from chance imbalances
(\citeproc{ref-hernan2024WHATIF}{Hernan \& Robins, 2024}). However, it
would be confusing to think of such an adjustment as `control.'

In real-world observational studies, where measured covariates are
sufficient to ensure conditional exchangeability across the treatment
groups to be compared -- also called, `no unmeasured confounding' or
`ignorability' -- we may obtain valid estimates for an average treatment
effect by conditioning on the densities of measured confounders by
treatment group. Where \(A = a\) and \(A = a^*\) are the treatment
levels we seek to contrast:

\[
\widehat{\text{ATE}} =  \sum_l \big( \mathbb{E}[Y(a^*) \mid L] - \mathbb{E}[Y(a) \mid L] \big) \times Pr(L)
\]

By causal consistency, we obtain:

\[
\widehat{\text{ATE}} =  \sum_l \big( \mathbb{E}[Y \mid A = a^*, L] - \mathbb{E}[Y \mid A = a, L] \big) \times Pr(L)
\]

For continuous covariates \(L\), we have:

\[
\widehat{\text{ATE}} = \int \big( \mathbb{E}[Y \mid A = a^*, L] - \mathbb{E}[Y \mid A = a, L] \big) dP(L)
\]

We may now state the primary function of a causal directed acyclic graph
(causal DAG), which is to identify sources of bias that may lead to an
association between an exposure and outcome in the absence of causation.
Causal DAGs visually encode features of a causal order necessary to
evaluate the assumptions of conditional exchangeability, or equivalently
of `no-unmeasured confounding', or equivalently of `ignorability' -- or
equivalently of `d-separation' (explained next). Although causal
directed acyclic graphs may be useful for addressing other biases such
as measurement error and target-population restriction bias (also called
`selection bias') (\citeproc{ref-bulbulia2024wierd}{Bulbulia, 2024d};
\citeproc{ref-hernan2024WHATIF}{Hernan \& Robins, 2024}), it is
important to understand that causal directed acyclic graphs are
specifically designed to evaluate the assumptions of conditional
exchangeability or `d-separation', any other use is strictly
`off-label'.

Finally, it is important to emphasise that without randomisation, we
typically cannot ensure there is no-unmeasured
confounding(\citeproc{ref-greifer2023}{Greifer et al., 2023};
\citeproc{ref-stuart2015}{Stuart et al., 2015}). For this reason, causal
data science workflows typically include sensitivity analyses to
determine how much unmeasured confounding would be required to
compromise a study's findings
(\citeproc{ref-vanderweele2017}{VanderWeele \& Ding, 2017}). Moreover,
even if investigators do not represent unmeasured common causes of
treatment and exposure in the causal DAGs they craft for observational
studies, we should assume there are umeasured common causes and plan
sensitivity analyses.

\subsubsection{Summary of Part 1}\label{summary-of-part-1}

Causal data science is distinct from ordinary data science. The initial
step involves formulating a precise causal question that clearly defines
a treatment or sequence of treatments, the outcome or outcomes to be
contrasted under treatment, and a population of interest called the
target population. We must then satisfy the three fundamental
assumptions required for causal inference, assumptions that are implicit
in the ideal of a randomised controlled experiment:

Causal consistency: Outcomes at the treatment levels to be compared must
align with their counterfactual counterparts. - \textbf{Positivity}:
Each treatment must have a non-zero probability across all covariates. -
\textbf{Conditional exchangeability}: There should be no unmeasured
confounding, meaning treatment assignment is ignorable conditional on
measured confounders, or equivalently, that treatment groups are
conditionally exchangeable.

\newpage{}

\subsection{Part 2: How Causal Directed Acyclic Graphs Clarify the
Conditional Exchangeability Assumption}\label{id-sec-2}

Next, I will introduce causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). I will
start by explaining the meaning of the symbols used. Refer to
supplementary materials S1 for a glossary of common causal inference
terms.

\subsubsection{Variable Naming
Conventions}\label{variable-naming-conventions}

\begin{table}

\caption{\label{tbl-terminology}Variable naming conventions}

\centering{

\terminologylocalconventionssimple

}

\end{table}%

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{\(X\)}: Denotes a random variable without reference to its
  role.
\item
  \textbf{\(A\)}: Denotes the `treatment' or `exposure'---a random
  variable. This is the variable for which we seek to understand the
  effect of intervening on it. It is the `cause.'
\item
  \textbf{\(A=a\)}: Denotes a fixed `treatment' or `exposure.' The
  random variable \(A\) is set to level \(A=a\).
\item
  \textbf{\(Y\)}: Denotes the outcome or response of an intervention. It
  is the `effect.'
\item
  \textbf{\(Y(a)\)}: Denotes the counterfactual or potential state of
  \(Y\) in response to setting the level of the treatment to a specific
  level, \(A=a\). The outcome \(Y\) as it would be observed when,
  perhaps contrary to fact, treatment \(A\) is set to level \(A=a\).
  Different conventions exist for expressing a potential or
  counterfactual outcome, such as \(Y^a\), \(Y_a\).
\item
  \textbf{\(L\)}: Denotes a measured confounder or set of confounders.
  This set, if conditioned upon, ensures that any differences between
  the potential outcomes under different levels of the treatment are the
  result of the treatment and not the result of a common cause of the
  treatment and the outcome. Mathematically, we write this independence:
\end{itemize}

\[
Y(a) \coprod A \mid L
\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{\(U\)}: Denotes an unmeasured confounder or confounders. \(U\)
  is a variable or set of variables that may affect both the treatment
  and the outcome, leading to an association in the absence of
  causality, even after conditioning on measured covariates:
\end{itemize}

\[
Y(a) \cancel{\coprod} A \mid L \quad \text{[because of unmeasured } U]
\]

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{\(F\)}: Denotes a modifier of the treatment effect. \(F\)
  alters the magnitude or direction of the effect of treatment \(A\) on
  an outcome \(Y\).
\item
  \textbf{\(M\)}: Denotes a mediator, a variable that transmits the
  effect of treatment \(A\) on an outcome \(Y\).
\item
  \textbf{\(\bar{X}\)}: Denotes a sequence of variables, for example, a
  sequence of treatments.
\item
  \textbf{\(\mathcal{R}\)}: Denotes a randomisation to treatment
  condition.
\item
  \textbf{\(\mathcal{G}\)}: Denotes a graph, here, a causal directed
  acyclic graph.
\end{itemize}

Note that investigators use a variety of different symbols. There is no
unique right way to create a causal directed acyclic graph, except that
meaning must be clear and the graph must be capable of identifying
relationships of conditional and unconditional independence between the
treatment and outcome. Although directed acyclic graphs are accessible
tools, general graphical models such as `Single World Intervention
Graphs,' which allow for the explicit representation of counterfactual
dependencies, may be preferable for investigators to estimate causal
effects under multiple interventions
(\citeproc{ref-bulbulia2024swigstime}{Bulbulia, 2024c};
\citeproc{ref-richardson2013}{Richardson \& Robins, 2013a}).

\subsubsection{Conventions We Use in This Article to Create Causal
Directed Acyclic
Graphs}\label{conventions-we-use-in-this-article-to-create-causal-directed-acyclic-graphs}

The conventions we use to describe components of our causal graphs are
given in Table~\ref{tbl-general}.

\begin{table}

\caption{\label{tbl-general}Nodes, Edges, Conditioning Conventions.}

\centering{

\terminologygeneraldags

}

\end{table}%

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Node}: a node or vertex represents characteristics or features
  of units within a population on a causal diagram -- that is a
  `variable.' In causal directed acyclic graphs, we draw nodes with
  respect to the \emph{target population}, which is the population for
  whom investigators seek causal inferences
  (\citeproc{ref-suzuki2020}{Suzuki et al., 2020}). Time-indexed node:
  \(X_t\) denotes relative chronology; \(X_{\customphi{t}}\) is our
  convention for indicating that timing is assumed, perhaps erroneously.
\item
  \textbf{Edge without an Arrow} (\(\association\)): path of
  association, causality not asserted.
\item
  \textbf{Red Edge without an Arrow} (\(\associationred\)): confounding
  path: ignores arrows to clarify statistical dependencies.
\item
  \textbf{Arrow} (\(\rightarrowNEW\)): denotes causal relationship from
  the node at the base of the arrow (a parent) to the node at the tip of
  the arrow (a child). We typically refrain from drawing an arrow from
  treatment to outcome to avoid asserting a causal path from \(A\) to
  \(Y\) because the function of a causal directed acyclic graph is to
  evaluate whether causality can be identified for this path.
\item
  \textbf{Red Arrow} (\(\rightarrowred\)): path of non-causal
  association between the treatment and outcome. Path is associational
  and may run against arrows.
\item
  \textbf{Dashed Arrow} (\(\rightarrowdotted\)): denotes a true
  association between the treatment and outcome that becomes partially
  obscured when conditioning on a mediator, assuming \(A\) causes \(Y\).
\item
  \textbf{Dashed Red Arrow} (\(\rightarrowdottedred\)): highlights
  over-conditioning bias from conditioning on a mediator.
\item
  \textbf{Open Blue Arrow} (\(\rightarrowblue\)): Highlights effect
  modification, occurring when the treatment effect levels vary within
  covariate levels. We do not assess the causal effect of the effect
  modifier on the outcome, recognising that intervening on the effect
  modifier may be incoherent. This is an off-label convention we use to
  clarify our interest in effect modification within strata of a
  covariate when there is a true treatment effect. However, it is
  possible to replace these open blue arrows with ordinary nodes and
  explain that the edges are drawn not for identification but for
  evaluating generalisations (see
  \citeproc{ref-bulbulia2024swigstime}{Bulbulia, 2024c}).
\item
  \textbf{Boxed Variable} \(\boxed{X}\): conditioning or adjustment for
  \(X\).
\item
  \textbf{Red-Boxed Variable} \(\boxedred{X}\): highlights the source of
  confounding bias from adjustment.
\item
  \textbf{Dashed Circle} \(\circledotted{X}\): no adjustment is made for
  a variable (implied for unmeasured confounders.)
\item
  \textbf{\(\mathbf{\mathcal{R}}\)} randomisation, for example,
  randomisation into treatment: \(\mathcal{R} \rightarrow A\).
\item
  \textbf{Presenting Temporal Order}: Causal directed acyclic graphs
  must be --- as truth in advertising implies--- \emph{acyclic.}
  Directed edges or arrows define ancestral relations. No descendant
  node can cause an ancestor node. Therefore causal diagrams are, by
  default, sequentially ordered.
\end{itemize}

Nevertheless, to make our causal graphs more readable, we adopt the
following conventions:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The layout of a causal diagram is structured from left to right to
  reflect the assumed sequence of causality as it unfolds.
\item
  We often index our nodes using \(X_t\) to indicate their relative
  timing and chronological order, where \(t\) represents the time point
  or sequence in the timeline of events.
\item
  Where temporal order is uncertain or unknown, we use the notation
  \(X_{\phi t}\) to propose a temporal order that is uncertain.
\end{enumerate}

Typically, the timing of unmeasured confounders is unknown, except that
they occur before the treatments of interest; hence, we place
confounders to the left of the treatments and outcomes they are assumed
to affect, but without any time indexing.

Again, temporal order is implied by the relationship of nodes and edges.
However, explicitly representing the order in the layout of one's causal
graph often makes it easier to evaluate, and the convention representing
uncertainty is useful, particularly when the data do not ensure the
relative timing of the occurrence of the variable in a causal graph.

More generally, investigators use various conventions to convey causal
structures on graphs. Whichever convention we adopt must be clear.

Finally, note that all nodes and paths on causal graphs---including the
absence of nodes and paths---are asserted. Constructing causal diagrams
requires expert judgment of the scientific system under investigation.
It is a great power given to those who construct causal graphs, and
\emph{with great power comes great responsibility to be transparent.}
When investigators are unclear or there is debate about which graphical
model fits reality, they should present multiple causal graphs. Where
identification is possible in several candidate causal graphs, they
should perform and report multiple analyses.

\subsubsection{How Causal Directed Acyclic Graphs Relate Observations to
Counterfactual
Interventions}\label{how-causal-directed-acyclic-graphs-relate-observations-to-counterfactual-interventions}

\paragraph{Ancestral Relations in Directed Acyclic
Graphs}\label{ancestral-relations-in-directed-acyclic-graphs}

We define the relation of `parent' and `child' on a directed acyclic
graph as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Node \(A\) is a \textbf{parent} of node \(B\) if there is a directed
  edge from \(A\) to \(B\), denoted \(A \rightarrow B\).
\item
  Node \(B\) is a \textbf{child} of node \(A\) if there is a directed
  edge from \(A\) to \(B\), denoted \(A \rightarrow B\).
\end{enumerate}

It follows that a parent and child are \textbf{adjacent nodes} connected
by a directed edge.

We denote the set of all parents of a node \(B\) as \(\text{pa}(B)\).

In a directed acyclic graph, the directed edge \(A \rightarrow B\)
indicates a statistical dependency where \(A\) may provide information
about \(B\). In a causal directed acyclic graph, the directed edge
\(A \rightarrow B\) is interpreted as a causal relationship, meaning
\(A\) is a direct cause of \(B\).

We further define the relations of \textbf{ancestor} and
\textbf{descendant} on a directed acyclic graph as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Node \(A\) is an \textbf{ancestor} of node \(C\) if there exists a
  directed path from \(A\) to \(C\). Formally, \(A\) is an ancestor of
  \(C\) if there exists a sequence of adjacent nodes
  \((A, B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_t, C)\) such that
  \(A \rightarrow B_1 \rightarrow B_2 \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow B_t \rightarrow C\).
\item
  Node \(C\) is a \textbf{descendant} of node \(A\) if there exists a
  directed path from \(A\) to \(C\). Formally, \(C\) is a descendant of
  \(A\) if there exists a sequence of adjacent nodes
  \((A, B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_t, C)\) such that
  \(A \rightarrow B_1 \rightarrow B_2 \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow B_t \rightarrow C\).
\end{enumerate}

It follows that a node can have multiple ancestors and multiple
descendants.

\paragraph{Markov Factorisation and the Local Markov
Assumption}\label{markov-factorisation-and-the-local-markov-assumption}

Pearl (\citeproc{ref-pearl2009a}{2009}) p.52 asks us to imagine the
following. Suppose we have a distribution \(P\) defined on n discrete
variables, \(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n\). By the chain rule, the joint
distribution for variables \(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n\) on a graph can be
decomposed into the product of \(n\) conditional distributions such that
we may obtain the following factorisation:

\[
\Pr(x_1, \dots, x_n) = \prod_{j=1}^n \Pr(x_j \mid x_1, \dots, x_{j-1})
\]

We translate nodes and edges on a graph into a set of conditional
independences that a graph implies over statistical distributions.

According to \textbf{the local Markov assumption}, given its parents in
a directed acyclic graph, a node is said to be independent of all its
non-descendants. Under this assumption, we obtain what Pearl calls
Bayesian network factorisation, such that:

\[
\Pr(x_j \mid x_1, \dots, x_{j-1}) = \Pr(x_j \mid \text{pa}_j)
\]

This factorisation greatly simplifies the calculation of the joint
distributions encoded in the directed acyclic graph (causal or
non-causal) by reducing complex factorisations of the conditional
distributions in \(\mathcal{P}\) to simpler conditional distributions in
the set \(\text{PA}_j\), represented in the structural elements of a
directed acyclic graph (\citeproc{ref-lauritzen1990}{Lauritzen et al.,
1990}; \citeproc{ref-pearl1988}{Pearl, 1988},
\citeproc{ref-pearl1995}{1995}, \citeproc{ref-pearl2009a}{2009}).

\paragraph{Minimality Assumption}\label{minimality-assumption}

The minimality assumption combines (a) the local Markov assumption with
(b) the assumption that adjacent nodes on the graph are dependent. This
is needed for causal directed acyclic graphs because the local Markov
assumption permits that adjacent nodes may be independent
(\citeproc{ref-neal2020introduction}{Neal, 2020}).

\paragraph{Causal Edges Assumption}\label{causal-edges-assumption}

The causal edges assumption states that every parent is a direct cause
of their children. Given the minimality assumption, the causal edges
assumption allows us to interpret the conditional dependence between
variables on a graph based on the causal relationships encoded by the
arrangement of nodes and edges
(\citeproc{ref-neal2020introduction}{Neal, 2020}).

\paragraph{Compatibility Assumption}\label{compatibility-assumption}

The compatibility assumption ensures that the joint distribution of
variables aligns with the conditional independencies implied by the
causal graph. This assumption requires that the probabilistic model
conforms to the graph's structural assumptions. Demonstrating
compatibility directly from data is challenging, as it involves
verifying that all conditional independencies specified by the causal
directed acyclic graph (DAG) are present in the data. Therefore, we
typically assume compatibility rather than empirically proving it
(\citeproc{ref-pearl2009a}{Pearl, 2009}).

\paragraph{Faithfulness}\label{faithfulness}

A causal diagram is considered faithful to a given set of data if all
the conditional independencies present in the data are accurately
depicted in the graph. Conversely, the graph is faithful if every
dependency implied by the graph's structure can be observed in the data
(\citeproc{ref-hernan2024WHATIF}{Hernan \& Robins, 2024}). Faithfulness
ensures that the graphical representation of relationships between
variables accords with empirical evidence
(\citeproc{ref-pearl2009a}{Pearl, 2009}).

We may distinguish between \textbf{weak faithfulness} and \textbf{strong
faithfulness}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Weak faithfulness} allows for the possibility that some
  observed independencies might occur by chance, such as chance
  cancellation of effects among multiple causal paths.
\item
  \textbf{Strong faithfulness} assumes that all observed statistical
  relationships directly reflect the underlying causal structure, with
  no difference left to chance.
\end{itemize}

The faithfulness assumption, whether weak or strong, is not directly
testable from observed data (\citeproc{ref-pearl2009a}{Pearl, 2009}).

\paragraph{d-separation}\label{d-separation}

In a causal diagram, a path is `blocked' or `d-separated' if a node
along it interrupts causation. Two variables are d-separated if all
paths connecting them are blocked, making them conditionally
independent. Conversely, unblocked paths result in `d-connected'
variables, implying potential dependence
(\citeproc{ref-pearl1995}{Pearl, 1995},
\citeproc{ref-pearl2009a}{2009}). (Note that `d' stands for
`directional'.)

The rules of d-separation are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Fork rule} (\(B \leftarrow \boxed{A} \rightarrow C\)): \(B\)
  and \(C\) are independent when conditioning on \(A\)
  (\(B \coprod C \mid A\)).
\item
  \textbf{Chain rule} (\(A \rightarrow \boxed{B} \rightarrow C\)):
  Conditioning on \(B\) blocks the path between \(A\) and \(C\)
  (\(A \coprod C \mid B\)).
\item
  \textbf{Collider rule} (\(A \rightarrow \boxed{C} \leftarrow B\)):
  \(A\) and \(B\) are independent unless conditioning on \(C\), which
  introduces dependence (\(A \cancel{\coprod} B \mid C\)).
\end{enumerate}

Judea Pearl proved d-separation in the 1990s
(\citeproc{ref-pearl1995}{Pearl, 1995},
\citeproc{ref-pearl2009a}{2009}).

It follows from d-separation that:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  An open path (no variables conditioned on) is blocked only if two
  arrows point to the same node: \(A \rightarrow C \leftarrow B\). The
  node of common effect (here \(C\)) is called a \emph{collider}.
\item
  Conditioning on a collider does not block a path; thus,
  \(A \rightarrow \boxed{C} \leftarrow B\) can lead to an association
  between \(A\) and \(B\) in the absence of causation.
\item
  Conditioning on a descendant of a collider does not block a path;
  thus, if \(C \rightarrow \boxed{C'}\), then
  \(A \rightarrow \boxed{C'} \leftarrow B\) is open.
\item
  If a path does not contain a collider, any variable conditioned along
  the path blocks it; thus, \(A \rightarrow \boxed{B} \rightarrow C\)
  blocks the path from \(A\) to \(C\)
  (\citeproc{ref-hernan2024WHATIF}{Hernan \& Robins, 2024, p. 78};
  \citeproc{ref-pearl2009a}{Pearl, 2009}).
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Backdoor Adjustment}\label{backdoor-adjustment}

From d-separation, Pearl was able to define a general identification
algorithm for causal identification, called the `backdoor adjustment
theorem' (\citeproc{ref-pearl2009a}{Pearl, 2009}).

Let us shift to the general notation that we will use in the following
examples. Where \(A\) denotes the treatment, \(Y\) denotes the outcome,
and \(L\) denotes a set (or subset) of measured covariates. In a causal
directed acyclic graph (causal DAG), we say that a set of variables
\(L\) satisfies the backdoor adjustment theorem relative to the
treatment \(A\) and the outcome \(Y\) if \(L\) blocks every path between
\(A\) and \(Y\) that contains an arrow pointing into \(A\) (a backdoor
path). Formally, \(L\) must satisfy two conditions:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  No element of \(L\) is a descendant of \(A\).
\item
  \(L\) blocks all backdoor paths from \(A\) to \(Y\).
\end{enumerate}

If \(L\) satisfies these conditions, the causal effect of \(A\) on \(Y\)
can be estimated by conditioning on \(\boxed{L}\)
(\citeproc{ref-pearl2009a}{Pearl, 2009}).

\subsection{Front Door Path Criterion}\label{front-door-path-criterion}

Pearl also proves a `front-door adjustment' criterion, which is rarely
used in practice but is worth understanding for its conceptual value.
The front-door criterion is useful when we cannot estimate the causal
effect of \(A\) on \(Y\) and there is unmeasured confounding by \(U\).
Suppose further, that there is a mediator, \(M\), that fully mediates
the effect of \(A\) on \(Y\). If \(A\to M\) is unconfounded and
\(M \to Y\) is unconfounded, \(A \to Y\) may be identified by estimating
the separate identifiable paths through \(M\). The front-door criterion
is not widely used because requires measuring an appropriate mediator
that fully captures the causal effect. However, understanding the
front-door adjustment helps develop intuition for how estimating causal
effects may be possible when there is unmeasured confounding
(\citeproc{ref-pearl2009a}{Pearl, 2009}).

\paragraph{Pearl's Structural Causal
Models}\label{pearls-structural-causal-models}

In the potential outcomes framework, we represent interventions by
setting variables to specific levels, e.g., setting the treatment to a
specific value \(A = \tilde{a}\). We have noted that counterfactual
outcomes are conceived as the outcomes that would occur if, perhaps
contrary to fact, an individual's treatment was set to a specific level.
We use the convention \(Y_i(a)\) or equivalently \(Y_i^{a}\) to denote
the counterfactual or `potential' outcome for individual \(i\) when that
individual's treatment is set to \(A_i = a\). Because we assume
individual treatments to be independent and identically distributed
(i.i.d.), we drop the subscripts when describing the potential outcomes
for multiple individuals under specific levels of treatment. Thus, we
write \(Y(a)\) or \(Y^a\) as shorthand for:

\[
Y(a) \equiv \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n Y_i(a)
\]

As noted above, we say that conditional exchangeability is satisfied if
the potential outcomes are independent of the treatment assignment
conditional on the measured covariates:

\[
A \coprod Y(\tilde{a}) \mid L
\]

It is worth considering that causal directed acyclic graphs do not
directly represent counterfactual outcomes. Instead, they evaluate
whether causality can be identified from hypothetical interventions on
the variables represented in a graph. Formally, causal directed acyclic
graphs rely on Judea Pearl's do-calculus
(\citeproc{ref-pearl2009a}{Pearl, 2009}), which relies on the concept of
an `interventional distribution'. Under Pearl's do-calculus, any node in
a graph can be intervened upon. Nodes and edges in a causal diagram
correspond to non-parametric structural equations or what Pearl calls
`structural causal models' (\citeproc{ref-pearl2009a}{Pearl, 2009}).
Note that non-parametric structural equations are causal-structural
models. They are fundamentally different from statistical structural
equation models that are employed in many human sciences. \textbf{Please
do not confuse non-parametric structural equation models with
statistical structural equation models}
(\citeproc{ref-vanderweele2015}{VanderWeele, 2015}). In a causal
directed acyclic graph, non-parametric structural equations represent
the underlying causal mechanisms without making specific parametric
assumptions about the functional forms of relationships. It is important
to note that non-parametric structural equations, also known as
structural causal models, are mathematical representations of the causal
relationships between variables in a system. These equations describe
the functional relationships between variables without specifying the
particular functional form or the probability distributions of the
variables. In contrast, statistical structural equation models, commonly
used in the social sciences and psychology, make specific assumptions
about the functional form of the relationships (e.g., linear,
polynomial, or exponential) and the probability distributions of the
variables (e.g., normal, Poisson, or binomial). Statistical structural
equation models model observed data. Non-parametric structural equations
state the assumed causal structure of the system -- we do not use
non-parametric structural equation models to do statistics. When we
employ statistical structural equation models or any other statistical
model, we must first state the assumed functional relationships that we
maintain (under expert advice) hold for the data. We must do so without
making assumptions about the functional form of the statistical model we
will eventually employ -- statistics come later, only after we have
evaluated whether the causal effect we seek may be identified with data.
Pearl's do-calculus and the rules of d-separation are based on
non-parametric structural equations, which provide a flexible and
generalisable framework for causal inference
(\citeproc{ref-pearl2009a}{Pearl, 2009}).

Pearl's structural causal models work as follows.

Let \(L\) denote the common causes of treatment \(A\) and outcome \(Y\):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The node \(L\) in the corresponding directed acyclic graph (DAG)
  \(\mathcal{G}\) corresponds to the non-parametric structural equation:
  \(L = f_L(U_L)\), where \(f_L\) is an unspecified function and \(U_L\)
  represents the exogenous error term or unmeasured factors affecting
  \(L\).
\item
  The treatment node \(A\) in \(\mathcal{G}\) is associated with the
  non-parametric structural equation: \(A = f_A(L, U_A)\), where \(f_A\)
  is an unspecified function, \(L\) represents the common causes, and
  \(U_A\) represents the exogenous error term or unmeasured factors
  affecting \(A\).
\item
  The outcome node \(Y\) in \(\mathcal{G}\) is associated with the
  non-parametric structural equation: \(Y = f_Y(A, L, U_Y)\), where
  \(f_Y\) is an unspecified function, \(A\) represents the treatment,
  \(L\) represents the common causes, and \(U_Y\) represents the
  exogenous error term or unmeasured factors affecting \(Y\).
\end{itemize}

In Pearl's formalism, we assume that \(U_L\), \(U_A\), and \(U_Y\) are
independent exogenous random variables. That is, we assume there are no
direct arrows linking \(A\) to \(Y\) except through the common cause
node \(L\). Causal diagrams allow us to factorise the joint distribution
of \(L\), \(A\), and \(Y\) as a product of conditional probability
distributions.

Define \(O\) as a distribution of independent and identically
distributed observations such that \(O = (L, A, Y)\). The true
distribution \(P_O\) is factorized as: \[
P_O = P_O(Y \mid A, L) P_O(A \mid L) P_O(L)
\]

Where: - \(P_O(L)\) is the marginal distribution of the covariates
\(L\). - \(P_O(A \mid L)\) is the conditional distribution of the
treatment given the covariates. - \(P_O(Y \mid A, L)\) is the
conditional distribution of the outcome given the treatment and
covariates.

Pearl's do-calculus allows us to evaluate the consequences of
intervening on variables represented in a causal DAG to interpret
probabilistic dependencies and independencies in the conditional and
marginal associations presented on a graph.

Here, we have developed counterfactual contrasts using the potential
outcomes framework. The potential outcomes framework considers potential
outcomes to be fixed and real (even if assigned non-deterministically).
Pearl develops counterfactual contrasts using operations on structural
functionals, referred to as `do-calculus'. In Pearl's framework, we
obtain counterfactual inference by assuming that the nodes in a causal
directed acyclic graph correspond to a system of structural equation
models, such as those we just described.

Mathematically, potential outcomes and counterfactual interventions are
equivalent, such that:

\[
\overbrace{\Pr(Y(a) = y)}^{\text{Potential Outcomes Framework}} \equiv \overbrace{\Pr(Y = y \mid do(A = a))}^{\text{Do-Calculus}}
\]

where the left-hand side of the equivalence is the potential outcomes
framework formalisation of a potential outcome recovered by causal
consistency, and the right-hand side is given by Pearl's do-calculus,
which, as just mentioned, formalises interventional distributions on
nodes of a graph that correspond to structural causal models.

In practice, whether one uses Pearl's do-calculus or the potential
outcomes framework to interpret causal inferences is often irrelevant to
identification results. However, there are theoretically interesting
debates about edge cases. For example, Pearl's structural causal models
permit the identification of contrasts that cannot be falsified under
any experiment (\citeproc{ref-richardson2013}{Richardson \& Robins,
2013a}). Because advocates of non-parametric structural equation models
treat causality as primitive, they are less concerned with the
requirement for falsification (\citeproc{ref-diaz2021nonparametric}{Dı́az
et al., 2021}, \citeproc{ref-Diaz2023}{2023};
\citeproc{ref-pearl2009a}{Pearl, 2009};
\citeproc{ref-rudolph2024mediation}{Rudolph et al., 2024}).
Additionally, the potential outcomes framework allows for identification
in settings where the error terms in a structural causal model are not
independent (\citeproc{ref-bulbulia2024swigstime}{Bulbulia, 2024c}).

I have presented the potential outcomes framework because it is easier
to interpret, more general, and---to my mind---clearer and more
intellectually compelling (moreover, one does not need to be a
verificationist to adopt it). However, for nearly every practical
purpose, the do-calculus and `po-calculus' (potential outcomes
framework, refer to Shpitser \& Tchetgen
(\citeproc{ref-shpitser2016causal}{2016})) are both mathematically and
practically equivalent. And remember, the nodes and edges in a causal
directed acyclic graph correspond to non-parametric structural
equations: these equations represent causal mechanisms \emph{without}
making specific assumptions about the functional form of the assumed
causal relationships encoded in the causal DAG. As currently employed,
the statistical structural equation models (SEMs) used in human sciences
often make implausible (or even incoherent) causal assumptions
(\citeproc{ref-bulbulia2024swigstime}{Bulbulia, 2024c};
\citeproc{ref-vanderweele2015}{VanderWeele, 2015}). It is generally
useful to draw a causal directed acyclic graph (causal DAG) before
considering a statistical structural equation model (SEM).

\subsubsection{The Five Elementary Rules for Causal
Identification}\label{the-five-elementary-rules-for-causal-identification}

Table~\ref{tbl-terminologyconfounders} describes five elementary rules
for identifying conditional independence using directed acyclic causal
diagrams.

\begin{table}

\caption{\label{tbl-terminologyconfounders}Five elementary rules for
causal identification.}

\centering{

\terminologyelconfounders

}

\end{table}%

There are no shortcuts to reasoning about causality. Each causal
question must be asked in the context of a specific scientific question,
and each causal graph must be built under the best lights of domain
expertise. However, the following five elementary rules for confounding
control are implied by the theorems that underpin causal directed
acyclic graphs. They may be a useful start for evaluating the prospects
for causal identification across a broad range of settings.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Ensure That Treatments Precede Outcomes}: This rule is a
  logical consequence of our assumption that causality follows the arrow
  of time and that a causal directed acyclic graph is faithful to this
  ordering. However, the assumption that treatments precede outcomes may
  be easily violated where investigators cannot ensure the relative
  timing of events from their data.
\end{enumerate}

Note that this assumption does not raise concerns in settings where past
outcomes may affect future treatments. Indeed, an effective strategy for
confounding control in such settings is to condition on past outcomes,
and where relevant, on past treatments as well. For example, if we wish
to identify the causal effect of \(A_1\) on \(Y_2\), and
repeated-measures time series data are available, it may be useful to
condition such that
\(\boxed{A_{-1}} \to \boxed{Y_0} \to A_1 \rightarrow Y_2\). Critically,
the relations of variables must be arranged sequentially without cycles.

Causal directed acyclic graphs must be acyclic. Yet most processes in
nature include feedback loops. However, there is no contradiction as
long as we represent these loops as sequential events. To estimate a
causal effect of \(Y\) on \(A\), we would focus on:
\(\boxed{Y_{-1}} \to \boxed{A_0} \to Y_1 \rightarrow A_2\). Departing
from conventions we have previously used to label treatments and
outcomes, here \(Y\) denotes the treatment and \(A\) denotes the
outcome.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item
  \textbf{Condition on Common Causes or Their Proxies}: This rule
  applies to settings in which the treatment \(A\) and the outcome \(Y\)
  share common causes. By conditioning on these common causes, we block
  the open backdoor paths that could introduce bias into our causal
  estimates. Controlling for these common causes (or their proxies)
  helps to isolate the specific effect of \(A\) on \(Y\). Note that we
  do not draw a path from \(A \to Y\) in this context because it
  represents an interventional distribution. In a causal directed
  acyclic graph, conditioning does not occur on interventional
  distributions. We do not box \(A\) and \(Y\).
\item
  \textbf{Do Not Condition on a Mediator when Estimating Total Effects}:
  This rule applies to settings in which the variable \(L\) is a
  mediator of \(A \to Y\). Recall Pearl's backdoor path criterion
  requires that we do not condition on a descendant of the treatment.
  Here, conditioning on \(L\) violates the backdoor path criterion,
  risking bias for a total causal effect estimate. We must not condition
  on a mediator if we are interested in total effect estimates. Note we
  draw the path from \(A \to Y\) to underscore that this specific
  overconditioning threat occurs in the presence of a true treatment
  effect. Over-conditioning bias can operate in the absence of a true
  treatment effect. This is important because conditioning on a mediator
  might create associations without causation. In many settings,
  ensuring accuracy in the relative timing of events in our data will
  prevent the self-inflicted injury of conditioning on a common effect
  of the treatment.
\item
  \textbf{Do Not Condition on a Collider}: This rule applies to settings
  in which \(L\) is a common effect of \(A\) and \(Y\). Conditioning on
  a collider may invoke a spurious association. Again, the backdoor path
  criterion requires that we do not condition on a descendant of the
  treatment. We would not be tempted to condition on \(L\) if we knew
  that it was an effect of \(A\). In many settings, ensuring accuracy in
  the relative timing of events in our data will prevent the
  self-inflicted injury of conditioning on a common effect of the
  treatment and outcome.
\item
  \textbf{Proxy Rule: Conditioning on a Descendant Is Akin to
  Conditioning on Its Parent}: This rule applies to settings where
  \(L'\) is an effect from another variable \(L\). The graph considers
  when \(L'\) is downstream of a collider. Here again, in many settings,
  ensuring accuracy in the relative timing of events in our data will
  prevent the self-inflicted injury of conditioning on a common effect
  of the treatment and outcome.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Summary Part 2}\label{summary-part-2}

We use causal directed acyclic graphs to represent and evaluate
structural sources of bias. We do not use these causal graphs to
represent the entirety of the causal system in which we are interested,
but rather only those features necessary to evaluate conditional
exchangeability, or equivalently to evaluate d-separation. Moreover,
causal directed acyclic graphs should not be confused with the
structural equation models employed in the statistical structural
equation modelling traditions (refer also to Rohrer et al.
(\citeproc{ref-rohrer2022PATH}{2022})). Although Pearl's formalism is
built upon `Non-Parametric Structural Equation Models,' the term
`Structural Equation Model' can be misleading. Causal directed acyclic
graphs are structural models that represent assumptions about reality,
they are not statistical models. We use structural causal models to
evaluate identifiability. We create causal graphs before we embark on
statistical modelling. They aim to clarify how to write statistical
models by elucidating which variables we must include in our statistical
models and, equally important, which variables we must exclude to avoid
invalidating our causal inferences. All causal graphs are grounded in
our assumptions about the structures of causation. Although it is
sometimes possible -- under assumptions -- to automate causal discovery
(\citeproc{ref-peters2016causal}{Peters et al., 2016}) we cannot fully
dispense with assumption because the causal structures of the world are
underdetermined by the data (\citeproc{ref-quine1981theories}{Quine,
1981}; \citeproc{ref-robins1999association}{J. M. Robins, 1999}).

THe distinction between structural and statistical models is fundamental
because absent clearly defined causal contrasts on well-defined
treatments, well-defined outcomes, and well-defined populations, and
absent carefully evaluated assumptions about structural sources of bias
in the relationship between treatments and outcomes, the statistical
structural equation modelling tradition offers no guarantees that the
coefficients investigators recover are interpretable. Misunderstanding
this difference between structural and statistical models has led to
considerable confusion across the human sciences
(\citeproc{ref-bulbulia2022}{Bulbulia, 2022},
\citeproc{ref-bulbulia2024swigstime}{2024c};
\citeproc{ref-vanderweele2015}{VanderWeele, 2015};
\citeproc{ref-vanderweele2022}{VanderWeele, 2022};
\citeproc{ref-vanderweele2022a}{VanderWeele \& Vansteelandt, 2022}).

\subsection{Part 3. How Causal Directed Acyclic Graphs Clarify the
Importance of Timing of Events Recorded in Data}\label{id-sec-3}

\begin{table}

\caption{\label{tbl-elementary-chronological-hyg}Causal DAGs illustrate
how ensuring the relative timing of the occurrence of variables of
interest addresses common forms of bias when estimating causal effects.}

\centering{

\terminologychronologicalhygeine

}

\end{table}%

As noted in the previous section, the five elementary rules of
confounding control reveal the importance of ensuring accurate timing in
the occurrence of the variables whose structural features a causal
directed acyclic graph encodes. We begin by considering seven examples
of confounding problems resolved when accuracy in the timing of the
occurrence of variables is ensured. These examples refer to causal
graphs in Table~\ref{tbl-elementary-chronological-hyg}. We use the
symbol \(\mathcal{G}\) to denote a graph. We use the convention:
\(\mathcal{G}_{\{\text{row}\}\{.\}\{1 = \text{problem}; 2 = \text{solution}\}}\)
to indicate a causal directed acyclic graph in the table.

\subsubsection{Example 1: Reverse
Causation}\label{example-1-reverse-causation}

Table~\ref{tbl-elementary-chronological-hyg} \(\mathcal{G}_{3.1}\)
illustrates bias from reverse causation. Suppose we are interested in
the causal effect of marriage on well-being. If we observe that married
people are happier than unmarried people, we might erroneously infer
that marriage causes happiness, or happiness causes marriage (refer to
McElreath (\citeproc{ref-mcelreath2020}{2020})).

Table~\ref{tbl-elementary-chronological-hyg} \(\mathcal{G}_{3.2}\)
clarifies a response. Ensure that the treatment is observed before the
outcome is observed. Note further that the treatment, in this case, is
not clearly specified because `marriage' is unclear. There are at least
four causal contrasts we might consider when thinking of `marriage',
namely:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \(Y(0, 0)\): The potential outcome when there is no marriage.
\item
  \(Y(0, 1)\): The potential outcome when there is a shift to marriage
  from no marriage.
\item
  \(Y(1, 0)\): The potential outcome under divorce.
\item
  \(Y(1, 1)\): The potential outcome from marriage prevalence.
\end{enumerate}

Each of these four outcomes may be contrasted with the others, yielding
six unique contrasts. Which do we wish to consider? `What is the causal
effect of marriage on happiness?' is ill-defined. This question does not
uniquely state which of the six causal contrasts to consider. The first
step in causal inference is to state a well-defined causal question in
terms of interventions and outcomes to be compared. For a worked example
refer to Bulbulia (\citeproc{ref-bulbulia2024swigstime}{2024c}).

\subsubsection{Example 2: Confounding by Common
Cause}\label{example-2-confounding-by-common-cause}

Table~\ref{tbl-elementary-chronological-hyg} \(\mathcal{G}_{3.2}\)
illustrates confounding by common cause. Suppose there is a common
cause, \(L\), of the treatment, \(A\), and outcome, \(Y\). In this
setting, \(L\) may create a statistical association between \(A\) and
\(Y\), implying causation in its absence. Most human scientists will be
familiar with the threat to inference in this setting: a `third
variable' leads to a statistical association between treatment and
outcome absent causation.

Suppose that smoking, \(L\), is a common cause of both yellow fingers,
\(A\), and cancer, \(Y\). Here, \(A\) and \(Y\) may show an association
without causation. If investigators were to scrub the hands of smokers,
this would not affect cancer rates.

Table~\ref{tbl-elementary-chronological-hyg} \(\mathcal{G}_{3.2}\)
clarifies a response. Condition on the common cause, smoking. Within
strata of smokers and non-smokers, there will be no association between
yellow fingers and cancer.

\subsubsection{Example 3: Mediator Bias}\label{example-3-mediator-bias}

Table~\ref{tbl-elementary-chronological-hyg} \(\mathcal{G}_{3.1}\)
illustrates mediator bias. Conditioning on the effect of treatment
blocks the flow of information from treatment to outcome, biasing the
total effect estimate.

Suppose investigators are interested in whether cultural `beliefs in big
Gods' \(A\) affect social complexity \(Y\). Suppose that `economic
trade', \(L\), is both a common cause of the treatment and outcome. To
address confounding by a common cause, we must condition on economic
trade. However, timing matters. If we condition on measurements that
reflect economic trade after the emergence of beliefs in big Gods, we
may bias our total effect estimate.

Table~\ref{tbl-elementary-chronological-hyg} \(\mathcal{G}_{3.2}\)
clarifies a response. Ensure that measurements of economic trade are
obtained for cultural histories before big Gods arise. Do not condition
on post-treatment instances of economic trade.

\subsubsection{Example 4: Collider Bias}\label{example-4-collider-bias}

Table~\ref{tbl-elementary-chronological-hyg} \(\mathcal{G}_{4.1}\)
illustrates collider bias. Imagine a randomised experiment investigating
the effects of different settings on individuals' self-rated health. In
this study, participants are assigned to either civic settings (e.g.,
community centres) or religious settings (e.g., places of worship). The
treatment of interest, \(A\), is the type of setting, and the outcome,
\(Y\), is self-rated health. Suppose there is no effect of setting on
self-rated health. However, suppose both setting and rated health
independently influence a third variable: cooperativeness. Specifically,
imagine religious settings encourage cooperative behaviour, and at the
same time, individuals with better self-rated health are more likely to
engage cooperatively. Now suppose the investigators decide to condition
on cooperativeness, which in reality is the common effect of \(A\) and
the outcome \(Y\). Their rationale might be to study the effects of
setting on health among those who are more cooperative or perhaps to
`control for' cooperation in the health effects of religious settings.
By introducing such `control', the investigators would inadvertently
introduce collider bias, because the control variable is a common effect
of the treatment and the outcome. If both \(A\) and \(Y\) are positively
associated with \(L\), \(A\) and \(Y\) will be negatively associated
with each other. However, such an association is a statistical artefact.
Were we to intervene on \(A\), \(Y\) would not change.

Table~\ref{tbl-elementary-chronological-hyg} \(\mathcal{G}_{4.2}\)
clarifies a response. If the worry is that cooperativeness is a
confounder, ensure that cooperativeness is measured before the
initiation of exposure to religious settings.

\subsubsection{Example 5: Collider Proxy
Bias}\label{example-5-collider-proxy-bias}

Table~\ref{tbl-elementary-chronological-hyg} \(\mathcal{G}_{5.1}\)
illustrates bias from conditioning on the proxy of a collider. Consider
again the scenario described in \(\sec 3.4\), but instead of controlling
for cooperativeness, investigators control for charitable donations, a
proxy for cooperativeness. Here, because the control variable is a
descendant of a collider, conditioning on the proxy of the collider is
akin to conditioning on the collider itself.

Table~\ref{tbl-elementary-chronological-hyg} \(\mathcal{G}_{5.2}\)
clarifies a response. Do not condition on charitable donations, an
effect of treatment.

\subsubsection{Example 6: Post-Treatment Collider Stratification
Bias}\label{example-6-post-treatment-collider-stratification-bias}

Table~\ref{tbl-elementary-chronological-hyg} \(\mathcal{G}_{6.1}\)
illustrates post-treatment collider stratification bias. Consider again
an experiment investigating the effect of religious service on
self-rated health. Suppose we measure `religiosity' after the
experiment, along with other demographic data. Suppose further that
religious setting affects religiosity, as does an unmeasured confounder,
such as childhood deprivation. Suppose that childhood deprivation
affects self-reported health. Although our experiment ensured
randomisation of the treatment and thus ensured no unmeasured common
causes of the treatment and outcome, conditioning on the post-treatment
variable `religiosity' opens a back-door path from the treatment to the
outcome. This path is
\(A_0 \associationred L_1 \associationred U \associationred Y_2\). We
introduced confounding into our randomised experiment.

Table~\ref{tbl-elementary-chronological-hyg} \(\mathcal{G}_{6.2}\)
clarifies a response. Do not condition on a variable that the treatment
may affect (refer to Cole et al. (\citeproc{ref-cole2010}{2010}) for a
discussion of theoretical examples; refer to Montgomery et al.
(\citeproc{ref-montgomery2018}{2018}) for evidence of the widespread
prevalence of post-treatment adjustment in published political science
experiments; refer also to Bulbulia
(\citeproc{ref-bulbulia_2024_experiments}{2024e})).

\subsubsection{Example 7: Conditioning on Past Treatments and Past
Outcomes to Control for Unmeasured
Confounders}\label{example-7-conditioning-on-past-treatments-and-past-outcomes-to-control-for-unmeasured-confounders}

Table~\ref{tbl-elementary-chronological-hyg} \(\mathcal{G}_{7.1}\)
illustrates the threat of unmeasured confounding. In `real world'
studies, this threat is ubiquitous.

Table~\ref{tbl-elementary-chronological-hyg} \(\mathcal{G}_{7.2}\)
clarifies a response. With at least three repeated measurements,
investigators may greatly reduce unmeasured confounding by controlling
for past measurements of the treatment as well as past measurements of
the outcome. With such control, any unmeasured confounder must be
orthogonal to its effects at baseline (refer to VanderWeele et al.
(\citeproc{ref-vanderweele2020}{2020})). Moreover, controlling for past
treatments allows investigators to estimate an incident exposure effect
over a prevalence exposure effect. The prevalence exposure effect
describes the effect of current or ongoing exposures (treatments) on
outcomes. This effect risks leading to erroneous conclusions. The
incident exposure effect targets initiation into treatment, which is
typically the effect we obtain from experiments. To obtain the incident
exposure effect, we generally require that events in the data can be
accurately classified into at least three relative time intervals (refer
to Hernán et al. (\citeproc{ref-hernuxe1n2016}{2016a}); Danaei et al.
(\citeproc{ref-danaei2012}{2012}); VanderWeele et al.
(\citeproc{ref-vanderweele2020}{2020}); Bulbulia
(\citeproc{ref-bulbulia2022}{2022})).

\subsection{Summary Part 3}\label{summary-part-3}

The examples in Part 3 reveal that the ability to order treatments,
outcomes, and their common causes on a timeline is necessary for
obtaining valid inferences. When timing is ensured, we can use Pearl's
backdoor path adjustment algorithm to evaluate identification, subject
to the assumptions encoded in a causal directed acyclic graph.

\newpage{}

\subsection{Part 4 How Causal Directed Acyclic Graphs Clarify The
Insufficiency of Ensuring The Timing of Events Recorded in Data For
Causal Identification}\label{id-sec-4}

We next present a series of illustrations that clarify ordering
variables in time is insufficient insurance against confounding biases.
All graphs in \hyperref[id-sec-4]{Part 4} refer to
Table~\ref{tbl-chronology-notenough}.

\begin{table}

\caption{\label{tbl-chronology-notenough}Common confounding scenarios in
which ordering of variable timing is insufficient for causal
identification.}

}

\end{table}%

\subsubsection{Example 1: M-bias}\label{example-1-m-bias}

Table~\ref{tbl-chronology-notenough} \(\mathcal{G}_{1.1}\) illustrates
the threat of over-conditioning on pre-treatment variables -- `M-bias'.
Suppose we want to estimate the effect of religious service attendance
on charitable donations. We obtain time-series data and include a rich
set of covariates, including baseline measures of religious service and
charity. Suppose there is no treatment effect. Suppose further that we
condition on loyalty measures, yet loyalty neither affects religious
service attendance nor charitable giving. However, imagine that loyalty
is affected by two unmeasured confounders. Furthermore, imagine that
one's childhood upbringing (an unmeasured variable) affects both loyalty
and inclinations to religious service but not charitable giving. \(U_A\)
denotes this unmeasured confounder. Furthermore, suppose wealth affects
loyalty and charitable giving but not religious service. \(U_Y\) denotes
this unmeasured confounder. In this setting, because loyalty is a
collider of the unmeasured confounders, conditioning on loyalty opens a
path between treatment and outcome. This path is
\(A \associationred U_A \associationred U_Y \associationred Y\).

Table~\ref{tbl-chronology-notenough} \(\mathcal{G}_{1.2}\) clarifies a
response. If we are confident that \(\mathcal{G}_{1.1}\) describes the
structural features of confounding, we should not condition on loyalty.

\subsubsection{Example 2: M-bias Where the Pre-treatment Collider is a
Confounder}\label{example-2-m-bias-where-the-pre-treatment-collider-is-a-confounder}

Table~\ref{tbl-chronology-notenough} \(\mathcal{G}_{2.1}\) illustrates
the threat of incorrigible confounding. Imagine the scenario in
\(\mathcal{G}_{1.1}\) and \(\mathcal{G}_{1.2}\) but with one change.
Loyalty is indeed a common cause of religious service attendance (the
treatment) and charitable giving (the outcome). If we do not condition
on loyalty, we have unmeasured confounding. This is bad. If we condition
on loyalty, as we have just considered, we also have unmeasured
confounding. This is also bad.

Table~\ref{tbl-chronology-notenough} \(\mathcal{G}_{2.2}\) clarifies a
response. Suppose that although we have not measured wealth, we have
measured a surrogate of wealth, say neighbourhood deprivation.
Conditioning on this surrogate is akin to conditioning on the unmeasured
confounder; we should adjust for neighbourhood deprivation.

\subsubsection{Example 3: Opportunities for Post-treatment Conditioning
for Confounder
Control}\label{example-3-opportunities-for-post-treatment-conditioning-for-confounder-control}

Table~\ref{tbl-chronology-notenough} \(\mathcal{G}_{3.1}\) illustrates
the threat of unmeasured confounding. Suppose we are interested in
whether curiosity affects educational attainment. The effect might be
unclear. Curiosity might increase attention but it might also increase
distraction. Consider an unmeasured genetic factor \(U\) that influences
both curiosity and educational attainment, say anxiety. Suppose we do
not have early childhood measures of anxiety in our dataset. We have
unmeasured confounding. This is bad.

Table~\ref{tbl-chronology-notenough} \(\mathcal{G}_{3.2}\) clarifies a
response. Suppose \(U\) also affects melanin production in hair
follicles. If grey hair is an effect of a cause of curiosity, and if
grey hair cannot be an effect of educational attainment, we could
diminish unmeasured confounding by adjusting for grey hair in adulthood.
This example illustrates how conditioning on a variable that occurs
after the treatment has occurred, or even after the outcome has been
observed, may prove useful for confounding control. When considering
adjustment strategies, it is sometimes useful to consider adjustment on
post-treatment confounders, however, it must be clear that the
confounder is not affected by the treatment.

\subsubsection{Example 4: Residual Confounding After Conditioning on
Past Treatments and Past
Outcomes}\label{example-4-residual-confounding-after-conditioning-on-past-treatments-and-past-outcomes}

Table~\ref{tbl-chronology-notenough} \(\mathcal{G}_{4}\) illustrates the
threat of confounding even after adjusting for baseline measures of the
treatment and the outcome. Imagine that childhood deprivation, an
unmeasured variable, affects both religious service attendance and
charitable giving. Despite adjusting for religious status and charitable
giving at baseline, childhood deprivation might influence changes in one
or both variables over time. This can create a longitudinal association
between religious service attendance and charitable giving without a
causal relationship. Strictly speaking, the causal effect cannot be
identified. We may estimate an effect and perform sensitivity analyses
to check how much unmeasured confounding would be required to explain
way an effect (refer to Linden et al.
(\citeproc{ref-linden2020EVALUE}{2020})); we may also seek negative
controls (refer to Hernan \& Robins
(\citeproc{ref-hernan2024WHATIF}{2024})).

\subsubsection{Example 5: Intermediary Confounding in Causal
Mediation}\label{example-5-intermediary-confounding-in-causal-mediation}

Table~\ref{tbl-chronology-notenough} \(\mathcal{G}_5\) illustrates the
threat of treatment confounding in causal mediation. Imagine that the
treatment is randomised; there is no treatment-outcome confounding. Nor
is there treatment-mediator confounding. \(\mathcal{R} \to A\) ensures
that backdoor paths from the treatment to the outcome are closed. We may
obtain biased results despite randomisation because the mediator is not
randomised. Suppose we are interested in whether the effects of COVID-19
lockdowns on psychological distress were mediated by levels of
satisfaction with the government. Suppose that assignment to COVID-19
lockdowns was random, and that time series data taken before COVID-19
provides comparable population-level contrasts. Despite random
assignment to treatment, assume that there are variables that may affect
both satisfaction with the government and psychological distress. For
example, job security or relationship satisfaction might plausibly
function as common causes of the mediator (government satisfaction) and
the outcome (psychological distress). To obtain valid inference for the
mediator-outcome path, we must control for these common causes.

Table~\ref{tbl-chronology-notenough} \(\mathcal{G}_5\) reveals the
difficulty in decomposing the total effect of COVID-19 on psychological
distress into the direct effect of COVID-19 that is not mediated by
satisfaction with the government and the indirect effect that is
mediated. Let us assume that confounders of the mediator-outcome path
are themselves potentially affected by the treatment. In this example,
imagine that COVID-19 lockdowns affect relationship satisfaction because
couples are trapped in ``captivity.'' Imagine further that COVID-19
lockdowns affect job security, which is reasonable if one owns a
street-facing business. If we adjust for these intermediary variables
along the path between the treatment and outcome, we will partially
block the treatment-mediator path. This means that we will not be able
to obtain a natural indirect effect estimate that decomposes the effect
of the treatment into that part that goes through the intermediary path
\(A \associationred V \associationred M \associationred Y\) and that
part that goes through the mediated path independently of \(V\), namely
\(A \associationred V \associationred M \associationred Y\). However, it
may be possible to estimate controlled direct effects---that is, direct
effects when the mediator is fixed to different levels
(\citeproc{ref-greenland1999}{Greenland et al., 1999};
\citeproc{ref-shpitser2022multivariate}{Shpitser et al., 2022};
\citeproc{ref-vanderweele2015}{VanderWeele, 2015}), or to obtain
approximations of the natural direct effect
(\citeproc{ref-bulbulia2024swigstime}{Bulbulia, 2024c}; refer to
\citeproc{ref-Diaz2023}{Dı́az et al., 2023};
\citeproc{ref-stensrud2023conditional}{Stensrud et al., 2023}).

\subsubsection{Example 6: Treatment Confounder Feedback in Sequential
Treatments}\label{example-6-treatment-confounder-feedback-in-sequential-treatments}

Table~\ref{tbl-chronology-notenough} \(\mathcal{G}_6\) illustrates the
threat of treatment confounder feedback in sequential treatment regimes.
Suppose we are interested in whether beliefs in big Gods affect social
complexity. Suppose that beliefs in big Gods affect economic trade and
that economic trade may affect beliefs in big Gods and social
complexity. Suppose the historical record is fragmented such that there
are unmeasured variables that affect both trade and social complexity.
Even if these unmeasured variables do not affect the treatment,
conditioning on the \(L\) (a confounder) and sequential treatment opens
a backdoor path
\(A \associationred L \associationred U \associationred Y\). We have
confounding.

Table~\ref{tbl-chronology-notenough} \(\mathcal{G}_6\) reveals the
difficulty of sequentially estimating causal effects. To estimate an
effect requires special estimators under the assumption of sequential
randomisation for fixed treatments and the assumption of strong
sequential randomisation for time-varying treatments---that is, for
treatments whose present levels depend on the levels of past treatments
and and measured confounders affected by those treatments
(\citeproc{ref-diaz2021nonparametric}{Dı́az et al., 2021};
\citeproc{ref-haneuse2013estimation}{Haneuse \& Rotnitzky, 2013};
\citeproc{ref-hernan2004STRUCTURAL}{Hernán et al., 2004};
\citeproc{ref-hoffman2023}{Hoffman et al., 2023};

\citeproc{ref-williams2021}{Williams \& Díaz, 2021};
\citeproc{ref-young2014identification}{Young et al., 2014}).

Importantly, we have six potential contrasts for the two sequential
treatments: beliefs in big Gods at both time points vs.~beliefs in big
Gods at neither time point; beliefs in big Gods first, then lost
vs.~never believing in big Gods at both:

\end{longtable}

We can compute six causal contrasts for these four fixed regimens, as
shown in Table~\ref{tbl-regimens}.

A limitation of directed acyclic causal diagrams is that we do not
project factorisations of the counterfactual contrasts onto the graphs
themselves. To evaluate counterfactual identification, using Single
World Intervention Graphs can be
helpful(\citeproc{ref-richardson2013swigsprimer}{Richardson \& Robins,
2013b}, \citeproc{ref-richardson2023potential}{2023};
\citeproc{ref-robins2010alternative}{J. M. Robins \& Richardson, 2010}).
I consider intermediate confounding in more detail in Bulbulia
(\citeproc{ref-bulbulia2024swigstime}{2024c}).

\subsubsection{Example 7: Collider Stratification Bias in Sequential
Treatments}\label{example-7-collider-stratification-bias-in-sequential-treatments}

Table~\ref{tbl-chronology-notenough} \(\mathcal{G}_7\) illustrates the
threat of confounding bias in sequential treatments even without
treatment-confounder feedback. Assume the setting is \(\mathcal{G}_6\)
with two differences. First, assume that the treatment, beliefs in big
Gods, does not affect trade networks. However, assume that an unmeasured
confounder affects both the beliefs in big Gods and the confounder,
trade networks. Such a confounder might be openness to outsiders, a
feature of ancient cultures for which no clear measures are available.
We need not imagine that treatment affects future states of confounders
for time-varying confounding. It would be sufficient to induce bias for
an unmeasured confounder to affect the treatment and the confounder, in
the presence of another confounder that affects both the confounder and
the outcome.

Table~\ref{tbl-chronology-notenough} \(\mathcal{G}_7\) reveals the
challenges of sequentially estimating causal effects. Yet again, to
estimate causal effects here requires special estimators, under the
assumption of sequential randomisation for fixed treatments, and the
assumption of strong sequential randomisation for time-varying
treatments (\citeproc{ref-diaz2021nonparametric}{Dı́az et al., 2021};
\citeproc{ref-haneuse2013estimation}{Haneuse \& Rotnitzky, 2013};
\citeproc{ref-hernan2004STRUCTURAL}{Hernán et al., 2004};
\citeproc{ref-hoffman2023}{Hoffman et al., 2023};
\citeproc{ref-richardson2013}{Richardson \& Robins, 2013a};
\citeproc{ref-robins1986}{J. Robins, 1986};
\citeproc{ref-rotnitzky2017multiply}{Rotnitzky et al., 2017};
\citeproc{ref-vanderlaan2011}{Van Der Laan \& Rose, 2011},
\citeproc{ref-vanderlaan2018}{2018};
\citeproc{ref-williams2021}{Williams \& Díaz, 2021};
\citeproc{ref-young2014identification}{Young et al., 2014}). We note
again that a specific causal contrast must be stated, and we must ask,
for which cultures do our causal effect estimates generalise.

Readers should be aware that merely applying currently popular tools of
time-series data analysis---multi-level models and structural equation
models---will not overcome the threats of confounding in sequential
treatments. Applying models to data will not recover consistent causal
effect estimates. Again, space constraints prevent us from discussing
statistical estimands and estimation here (refer to Bulbulia
(\citeproc{ref-bulbulia2024PRACTICAL}{2024a})).

\subsubsection{Summary Part 4}\label{summary-part-4}

Directed acyclic graphs reveal that ensuring the timing of events in
one's data does not ensure identification. In some cases, certain
mediated effects cannot be identified by any data, as we discussed in
the context of mediation analysis with intermediate confounding.
However, across the human sciences, we often apply statistical models to
data and interpret the outputs as meaningful. Causal diagrams
demonstrate that standard approaches, no matter how sophisticated, are
often hazardous and can lead to misleading conclusions.

\subsection{Part 5. Creating Causal Diagrams: Pitfalls and
Tips}\label{id-sec-5}

The primary interest of causal diagrams is to address
\textbf{identification problems}. Pearl's backdoor adjustment theorem
proves that if we adopt an adjustment set such that \(A\) and \(Y\) are
d-separated, and furthermore do not condition on a variable along the
path from \(A\) to \(Y\), then association is causation.

Here is how investigators may construct safe and effective directed
acyclic graphs.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Clarify the causal question and target population}
\end{enumerate}

An identification strategy is relative to the question at hand. The
adjustment criteria for estimating an effect of \(A\) on \(Y\) will
generally differ from those for estimating an effect of \(Y\) on \(A\).
Before attempting to draw any causal diagram, state the problem your
diagram addresses and the population to whom it applies. Additionally,
when adopting a specific identification strategy for a treatment or set
of treatments, the coefficients we obtain for the other variables in the
model will often be biased causal effect estimates for those variables.

Moreover, the \emph{coefficients obtained from statistical models
developed to estimate causal effects will typically not have a marginal
interpretation} (\citeproc{ref-chatton2020}{Chatton et al., 2020};
\citeproc{ref-cole2008}{Cole \& Hernán, 2008};
\citeproc{ref-vanderweele2009a}{VanderWeele, 2009}). This implication
has wide-ranging consequences for scientific reporting. For example, if
regression coefficients are reported at all, they should come with clear
warnings against interpreting them as having any causal meaning or
interpretation (\citeproc{ref-bulbulia2023}{Bulbulia, 2024b};
\citeproc{ref-mcelreath2020}{McElreath, 2020};
\citeproc{ref-westreich2013}{Westreich \& Greenland, 2013}). Powerful
machine learning algorithms treat these parameters as a nuisance, and in
many cases, coefficients cannot be obtained. Referees of human science
journals need to be alerted to this fact and retrained accordingly.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item
  \textbf{Consider whether the three fundamental assumptions for causal
  inference may be satisfied}

  Merely possessing data, even if the data are richly detailed
  time-series data, does not mean our causal questions will find
  answers. Along with identification, we must also consider the causal
  consistency and positivity assumptions, refer to
  \hyperref[id-sec-1]{Part 1}.
\item
  \textbf{Clarify the meanings of symbols and conventions}

  It is fair to say that the state of terminology in causal inference is
  a dog's breakfast (for a glossary, refer to supplement \textbf{S1}).
  Meanings and conventions vary not only for terminology but also for
  causal graphical conventions. For example, whereas we have denoted
  unmeasured confounders using the variable \(U\), those who follow
  Pearl will often draw a bi-directional arrow. Although investigators
  will have their preferences, there is generally little substantive
  interest in one's conventions, only that they are made clear,
  frequently repeated (as I have done repeatedly in the key for each
  graph table), and applied correctly.
\item
  \textbf{Include all common causes of the treatment and outcome}

  Once we have stated our causal question, we are ready to create a
  draft of our causal graph. This graph should incorporate the most
  recent common causes (parents) of both the treatment and the outcome,
  or, where measures are not available, measures for available proxies.

  Where possible, aggregate functionally similar common causes and label
  them with a single node. For example, all baseline confounders that
  are a common cause of the treatment and outcome might be labelled
  \(L_0\). Time-varying confounders might be labelled
  \(L_1, L_2, \dots L_{\tau -1}\), where \(Y_\tau\) is the outcome at
  the end of study.

  How do we determine whether a variable is a common cause of the
  treatment and the outcome? We might not always be in a position to
  know. Remember that a causal directed acyclic graph (DAG) asserts
  structural assumptions. Expertise in crafting causal diagrams does not
  guarantee expertise in encoding plausible structural assumptions!
  Therefore, creating and revising causal DAGs should involve topic
  specialists. Additionally, the decision-making processes should be
  thoroughly documented in published research, even if this
  documentation is placed in supplementary materials.
\item
  \textbf{Consider potential unmeasured confounders}

  We leverage domain expertise not only to identify measured sources of
  confounding but also---and perhaps most importantly---to identify
  potential unmeasured confounders. These should be included in our
  causal diagrams. Because we cannot guard against all unmeasured
  confounding, it is essential to perform sensitivity analyses and to
  consider developing multiple analytic strategies to provide multiple
  channels of evidence for the question at hand, such as instrumental
  variables, negative control treatments, negative control outcomes, and
  mendelian randomisation (\citeproc{ref-angrist2009mostly}{Angrist \&
  Pischke, 2009}; \citeproc{ref-smith2022combining}{Smith et al.,
  2022}).
\item
  \textbf{Ensure the causal directed acyclic graph is acyclic and
  practice good chronological hygiene}

  Although not strictly necessary, it may be useful to annotate the
  temporal sequence of events using subscripts (e.g., \(L_0\), \(A_1\),
  \(Y_2\)), as we have done here. Moreover, it is a great help to your
  audience (and to yourself) to spatially order your directed acyclic
  graph to reflect the progression of causality in time---either
  left-to-right or top-to-bottom. What might be called `chronological
  hygiene' will considerably enhance comprehensibility, and allow you to
  spot errors you might otherwise miss -- such as worrying about whether
  a post-treatment variable is a confounder -- it is not -- and we
  should not condition on an effect of the treatment if our interest is
  in a total treatment effect. Note there are other post-treatment
  biases to worry about, such as directed measurement error bias
  (\citeproc{ref-bulbulia2024wierd}{Bulbulia, 2024d}), however, it is
  perilous to fix such biases through adjustment.
\item
  \textbf{Represent paths structurally, not parametrically}

  Whether a path is linear is unimportant for causal
  identification---and remember causal diagrams are tools for causal
  identification. Focus on whether paths exist, not their functional
  form (linear, non-linear, etc.).

  Consider a subway map of Paris. We do not include all the streets on
  this map, all noteworthy sites, or a detailed overview of the holdings
  by room in the Louvre. We use other maps for these purposes. Remember,
  the primary function of a causal diagram is to ensure d-separation. If
  a causal diagram is to be useful, it must remove almost every detail
  about the reality it assumes.
\item
  \textbf{Minimise paths to those necessary for addressing an
  identification problem}

  Reduce clutter; only include paths critical for a specific question
  (e.g., backdoor paths, mediators). For example, in
  Table~\ref{tbl-chronology-notenough} \(\mathcal{G} 6\) and
  Table~\ref{tbl-chronology-notenough} \(\mathcal{G} 7\), I did not draw
  arrows from the first treatment to the second treatment. Although I
  assume that such arrows exist, drawing them was not, in these
  examples, relevant to evaluating the identification problem at hand.
\item
  \textbf{When Temporal Order is Unknown, Explicitly Represent This
  Uncertainty on Your Causal Diagram}

  In many settings, the relevant timing of events cannot be ascertained
  with confidence. To address this, we adopt the convention of indexing
  nodes with uncertain timing using \(X_{\phi t}\) notation. Although
  there is no widely adopted convention for representing uncertainty in
  timing, our primary obligation is to be clear.
\item
  \textbf{Create, Report, and Deploy Multiple Graphs}
\end{enumerate}

Causal inference hinges on assumptions, and experts might disagree. When
the structure of reality encoded in a causal graph is uncertain or
debated, investigators should produce multiple causal diagrams that
reflect these uncertainties and debates.

By stating different assumptions and adopting multiple modelling
strategies that align with these assumptions, we might find that our
causal conclusions are robust despite differences in structural
assumptions. Even when different structural assumptions lead to opposing
causal inferences, this knowledge can guide future data collection to
resolve these differences. The primary goal of causal inference, as with
all science, is to truthfully advance empirical understanding.
Assertions are poor substitutes for honesty. Rather than asserting a
single causal directed graph, investigators should follow the
implications of several.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{10}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Use Automated Identification Algorithms such as
  \texttt{daggity} with Care}
\end{enumerate}

Automated software can assist with identification tasks, such as
factorising complex conditional independencies. However, automated
software may not converge on identifying the optimal set of confounders
in the presence of intractable confounding.

Consider Tyler VanderWeele's \textbf{modified disjunctive cause
criterion}. VanderWeele (\citeproc{ref-vanderweele2019}{2019})
recommends obtaining a maximally efficient adjustment, termed a
`confounder set.' A member of this set is any variable that can reduce
or remove structural sources of bias. The strategy is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Control for any variable that causes the treatment, the outcome, or
  both.
\item
  Control for any proxy of an unmeasured variable that is a shared cause
  of both the treatment and outcome.
\item
  Define an instrumental variable as a variable associated with the
  treatment but not influencing the outcome independently, except
  through the treatment. Exclude any instrumental variable that is not a
  proxy for an unmeasured confounder from the confounder set
  (\citeproc{ref-vanderweele2019}{VanderWeele, 2019}).
\end{enumerate}

VanderWeele's modified disjunctive cause criterion is an excellent
strategy for selecting an optimal confounder set. However, this set
might not remove all structural sources of confounding bias in most
observational settings. As such, an automated algorithm might reject it.
This rejection could be unwise because, in non-randomised treatment
assignments, we should often include relations of unmeasured confounding
in our causal graphs. Rejecting causal inferences in observational
settings entirely would be imprudent, as many examples closely
approximate randomised control trials
(\citeproc{ref-hernan2008aObservationalStudiesAnalysedLike}{Hernán et
al., 2008b}; \citeproc{ref-hernan2016}{Hernán et al., 2016b};
\citeproc{ref-hernan2006estimating}{Hernán \& Robins, 2006b}).

For example, consider Table~\ref{tbl-chronology-notenough}
\(\mathcal{G}_{2.1}\), where we encountered intractable confounding.
What if there were no proxy for an unmeasured confounder? Should we
condition on the measured confounder and induce M-bias, leave the
backdoor path from the measured confounder open, or not attempt causal
inferences at all? The answer depends on assumptions about the relative
strength of confounding in the causal diagram. Rather than relying on a
generic strategy, we require subject-specialist expertise, sensitivity
analyses, and multiple causal identification strategies
(\citeproc{ref-smith2022combining}{Smith et al., 2022}).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{11}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Clarify Assumptions about Structural Bias from Measurement
  Error and Target Population Restriction (also known as `Selection
  Bias')}
\end{enumerate}

Space constraints prevented us from examining how causal directed
acyclic graphs can clarify structural biases from measurement error and
restrictions of the target population in the sample population at the
start and end of the study. We can (and should) examine structural
features of bias in these settings. For an overview, refer to Bulbulia
(\citeproc{ref-bulbulia2024wierd}{2024d}).

\subsection{Conclusions}\label{id-sec-6}

\paragraph{Limitations}\label{limitations}

\textbf{First, I have focused on the application of causal diagrams to
confounding bias; however, there are other biases that threaten causal
inference besides confounding biases.} Causal directed acyclic graphs
can also be extended to evaluate measurement-error biases and some
features of target population restriction bias (also called `selection
restriction bias'). Valid causal inferences require addressing all
structural sources of bias. This work does not aim for complete coverage
of how causal diagrams may be useful for off-label applications other
than assessing d-separation, but it hopes to stimulate curiosity
(\citeproc{ref-bulbulia2024wierd}{Bulbulia, 2024d};
\citeproc{ref-hernan2024WHATIF}{Hernan \& Robins, 2024};
\citeproc{ref-hernan2017SELECTIONWITHOUTCOLLIDER}{Hernán, 2017};
\citeproc{ref-hernan2009MEASUREMENT}{Hernán \& Cole, 2009};
\citeproc{ref-liu2023application}{Liu et al., 2023};
\citeproc{ref-vanderweele2012MEASUREMENT}{VanderWeele \& Hernán, 2012}).

\textbf{Second, I have not reviewed other graphical tools for
identification, such as Single World Intervention Graphs}. Although
causal directed acyclic graphs are powerful tools for addressing
identification problems, they are not the only graphical tools
researchers use to investigate causality. For example, J. Robins
(\citeproc{ref-robins1986}{1986}) developed the `finest fully randomized
causally interpreted structured tree graph (FFRCISTG),' which has been
more recently revived and simplified in Single World Intervention Graphs
(refer to Richardson \& Robins
(\citeproc{ref-richardson2013swigsprimer}{2013b})). These graphs
explicitly factorise counterfactual states, which can be helpful for
identification in complex longitudinal settings. For some, representing
counterfactual states on a graph is more satisfying, as it allows
inspection of the conditional independence of expectations over
\(Y(a^*)\) and \(Y(a)\) separately. Refer to Bulbulia
(\citeproc{ref-bulbulia2024swigstime}{2024c}) for use cases.

\textbf{Third, I have not reviewed workflows downstream of causal
identification}. This article does not cover statistical estimands,
statistical estimation, and the interpretation and reporting of causal
inferences, which come downstream of causal graphs in causal inference
workflows. Rapid developments in machine learning offer applied
researchers new tools for handling model misspecification
(\citeproc{ref-diaz2021nonparametric}{Dı́az et al., 2021};
\citeproc{ref-hoffman2023}{Hoffman et al., 2023};
\citeproc{ref-van2012targeted}{Laan \& Gruber, 2012};
\citeproc{ref-vanderlaan2018}{Van Der Laan \& Rose, 2018};
\citeproc{ref-williams2021}{Williams \& Díaz, 2021}) and assessing
treatment effect heterogeneity (\citeproc{ref-athey2019}{Athey et al.,
2019}; \citeproc{ref-athey2021}{Athey \& Wager, 2021};
\citeproc{ref-vansteelandt2022a}{Vansteelandt \& Dukes, 2022};
\citeproc{ref-wager2018}{Wager \& Athey, 2018}). Those interested in
workflows for causal inference in panel studies might consider
VanderWeele et al. (\citeproc{ref-vanderweele2020}{2020}). The workflows
in my research group can be found here: Bulbulia
(\citeproc{ref-bulbulia2024PRACTICAL}{2024a}). For general approaches, I
recommend: \href{https://tlverse.org/tmle3/}{https://tlverse.org/tmle3/,
accessed 10 June 2024}. However, readers should be aware that workflows
for statistical designs and estimation are quickly evolving.

Nevertheless, after precisely stating our causal question, the most
difficult and important challenge is considering whether and how it
might be identified in the data. The `statistical models first' approach
routinely applied in most human sciences is soon ending. This approach
has been attractive because it is relatively easy to implement---the
methods do not require extensive training---and because the application
of statistical models to data appears rigorous. However, if the
coefficients we recover from these methods have meaning, this is
typically accidental. Without a causal framework, these coefficients are
not just uninformative about what works and why; they lack any meaning
(\citeproc{ref-ogburn2021}{Ogburn \& Shpitser, 2021}).

There are many good resources available for learning causal directed
acyclic graphs (\citeproc{ref-barrett2021}{Barrett, 2021};
\citeproc{ref-cinelli2022}{Cinelli et al., 2022};
\citeproc{ref-greenland1999}{Greenland et al., 1999},
\citeproc{ref-greenland1999}{1999};
\citeproc{ref-hernan2024WHATIF}{Hernan \& Robins, 2024};
\citeproc{ref-major2023exploring}{Major-Smith, 2023};
\citeproc{ref-mcelreath2020}{McElreath, 2020};
\citeproc{ref-morgan2014}{Morgan \& Winship, 2014};
\citeproc{ref-pearl2009a}{Pearl, 2009};
\citeproc{ref-rohrer2018}{Rohrer, 2018};
\citeproc{ref-suzuki2020}{Suzuki et al., 2020}). This work aims to add
to these resources, first by providing additional conceptual orientation
to the frameworks and workflows of causal data science, highlighting the
risks of applying causal graphs without this understanding; second, by
using causal diagrams to emphasise the importance of ensuring relative
timing for the variables whose causal relationships are represented on
the graph; third, by employing causal diagrams to clarify the
limitations of longitudinal data for certain questions in causal
mediation and time-varying confounding under time-varying treatments,
which remain topics of confusion in many human sciences (see Bulbulia
(\citeproc{ref-bulbulia2024swigstime}{2024c}) for a detailed
explanation).

For those just getting started on causal diagrams, I recommend Miguel
Hernan's free course here:
\href{https://www.edx.org/learn/data-analysis/harvard-university-causal-diagrams-draw-your-assumptions-before-your-conclusions}{https://www.edx.org/learn/data-analysis/harvard-university-causal-diagrams-draw-your-assumptions-before-your-conclusions,
accessed 10 June 2024}

For those seeking a slightly more technical but still accessible
introduction to causal inference and causal DAGs, I recommend Brady
Neal's introduction to causal inference course and textbook, both freely
available here
\href{https://www.bradyneal.com/causal-inference-course}{https://www.bradyneal.com/causal-inference-course,

\subsubsection{Neurath's Boat: On the Priority of Assumptions in
Science}\label{neuraths-boat-on-the-priority-of-assumptions-in-science}

We might wonder, if not from the data, where do our assumptions about
causality come from? We have said that our assumptions must come from
expert knowledge. Our reliance on expert knowledge might seem
counterintuitive for building scientific knowledge. Shouldn't we use
data to build scientific knowledge, not the other way around? Isn't
scientific history a record of expert opinions being undone?

The Austrian philosopher Otto Neurath famously described scientific
progress using the metaphor of a ship that must be rebuilt at sea:

\begin{quote}
\ldots{} every statement about any happening is saturated with
hypotheses of all sorts and these in the end are derived from our whole
world-view. We are like sailors who on the open sea must reconstruct
their ship but are never able to start afresh from the bottom. Where a
beam is taken away a new one must at once be put there, and for this the
rest of the ship is used as support. In this way, by using the old beams
and driftwood, the ship can be shaped entirely anew, but only by gradual
reconstruction. (\citeproc{ref-neurath1973}{Neurath, 1973, p. 199})
\end{quote}

Neurath emphasises the iterative process of accumulating scientific
knowledge; new insights are formed from the foundation of existing
knowledge (\citeproc{ref-godfrey2006strategy}{Godfrey-Smith, 2006},
\citeproc{ref-godfrey2009theory}{2009};
\citeproc{ref-quine1981theories}{Quine, 1981}).

Causal diagrams are at home in Neurath's boat. We should resist the
tradition of science that believes knowledge develops solely from the
results of statistical tests applied to data. The data have never fully
contained the answers we seek. When reconstructing knowledge, we have
always relied on assumptions. Causal graphs enable us to make these
assumptions explicit and to understand what we obtain based on them.
