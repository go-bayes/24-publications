title: "The New Zealand Muslim Diversity Study: Baseline Sample Information 2023-2024"
abstract: |
  In this study, we present demographic statistics from the first wave of the New Zealand Muslim Diversity Study (MSD 2023-2024). We describe patterns of religious identity and behaviour within the MDS cohort and examine self-reported multi-dimensional well-being. By comparing Muslim demographic, religious, and psychological diversity with that of the broader New Zealand population, we discover patterns of variation within and between religious groups that are not evident from group affiliations alone. Our findings uncover new commonalities between Muslims and other highly religious groups in New Zealand, and clarify that group-level averages do not capture the full spectrum of individual religious differences.

The New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS) is a nationally representative panel study of New Zealanders started in 2009. It has measured `r n_total` participants annually, and is presently tracking `r n_15` participants, about 1% of New Zealand's adult population. 

Despite strong NZAVS coverage of New Zealand's denominations, in the largest NZAVS cohort, less than .01% of New Zealand's Muslims were participating (n = `r n_mus_pre`). That is, the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study was under-representing Muslims by an order of magnitude below the New Zealand census estimates. 

The Muslim Diversity Study, led by Usman Afzali (UA), has been built through partnership with the Muslim community partnerships to boost the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Muslim sample by ~600 participants to obtain coverage of about 1% of the New Zealand Census estimate of New Zealand Muslim Community.

The premise of this study has been to enable extend national longitudinal science of the study of Muslim diversity and flourishing over the lifespan, to understand the scope of such diversity and the challenges to such flourishing, and to clarify the affordances through which Muslims overcome adversity that has been previously documented in other research (refs.)

The Muslim Diversity Study is important first, because the lifelong dynamics of Muslim flourishing are poorly understood; this project addresses an urgent scientific need.

Second, our work with the Muslim community revealed a strong community interest in Muslim flourishing science; this project is an attempt to address this interest by involving Muslims in this science. 

Third, this project serves as a model for developing panel studies of under-represented groups in Aoteoroa New Zealand and in other countries. 


## Method

Measures are presented in [Appendix A](#appendix-a)

### Sample

The New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study is a national probability study designed to accurately reflect the broader New Zealand population. It uses prize draws to incentivise participation. Although the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study has good demographic representation of the country as a whole, it tends to under-sample males and individuals of Asian descent and over-sample females and Māori (the indigenous peoples of New Zealand). To address enhance the accuracy of our findings for the target population, we apply 2018 New Zealand Census survey weights to the sample data. These weights adjust for variations in age, gender, and ethnicity to better approximate the national demographic composition [@sibley2021]. 

**OFFICIAL NZAVS DOCUMENTATION HERE**


### Design 

We compare and contrast the Muslim sample with other religious groups, including those secular people who do not identify as religious. This research is descriptive an exploratory. 

Study 1 reports religious beliefs, identity, and practices of Muslims and other religious groups.

Study 2 reports perceived religious, ethnic, gender, and age-based prejudice.

Study 3 reports indicators related to biological health

Study 4 reports self-related well-being

Study 5 reports life-related well-being

Study 6 reports social well-being. 


In studies 2-7, our models adjust for the following demographic indicators that are unlikely to be affected by religious (or secular affiliation): age, gender, whether someone is New Zealand Born, and ethnicity.  Such adjustments allow us to focus on those features of multi-dimensional well-being that associated with religious (and secular) affiliation. 


 
### Eligibility Criteria

Participants needed to respond to the 2023 wave of the New Zealand Attitudes Study, and to have complete information about religious identification (yes or no). A total of `r n_participants` individuals met these criteria and were included in the study. 



### Missing Data

To mitigate bias from missing data, we imputed missing responses using the `ppm` algorithm from the `mice` package in R [@vanbuuren2018].  Overall missingness accounts for less than `r prop_miss_case`% if the data. However, we note that missingness for certain indicators among Muslims is considerably higher than among other groups ...
