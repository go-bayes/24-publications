The New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS) is a nationally representative panel study of New Zealanders started in 2009. It has measured `r n_total` participants annually, and is presently tracking `r n_15` participants, about 1% of New Zealand's adult population. 

Despite strong NZAVS coverage of New Zealand's denominations, in the largest NZAVS cohort, less than .01% of New Zealand's Muslims were participating (n = `r n_mus_pre`). That is, the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study was under-representing Muslims by an order of magnitude below the New Zealand census estimates. 

The Muslim Diversity Study, led by Usman Afzali (UA), has been built through partnership with the Muslim community partnerships to boost the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Muslim sample by ~600 participants to obtain coverage of about 1% of the New Zealand Census estimate of New Zealand Muslim Community.

The premise of this study has been to enable extend national longitudinal science of the study of Muslim diversity and flourishing over the lifespan, to understand the scope of such diversity and the challenges to such flourishing, and to clarify the affordances through which Muslims overcome adversity that has been previously documented in other research (refs.)

The Muslim Diversity Study is important first, because the lifelong dynamics of Muslim flourishing are poorly understood; this project addresses an urgent scientific need.

Second, our work with the Muslim community revealed a strong community interest in Muslim flourishing science; this project is an attempt to address this interest by involving Muslims in this science. 

Third, this project serves as a model for developing panel studies of under-represented groups in Aoteoroa New Zealand and in other countries.

### Sample

The New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study is a national probability study designed to accurately reflect the broader New Zealand population. It uses prize draws to incentivise participation. Although the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study has good demographic representation of the country as a whole, it tends to under-sample males and individuals of Asian descent and over-sample females and MƒÅori (the indigenous peoples of New Zealand). To address enhance the accuracy of our findings for the target population, we apply 2018 New Zealand Census survey weights to the sample data. These weights adjust for variations in age, gender, and ethnicity to better approximate the national demographic composition [@sibley2021].

### Design 

First, we report descriptive demographic information about the Muslim sample.  We do so by comparing it to the secular sample and to other religious groups. 

Second, we model the expected average responses to the religion-related indicators in the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study, as well prejudice-related indicators. These statistical models are also descriptive. 


### Eligibility Criteria

To be eligible, participants needed to respond to the 2023 wave of the New Zealand Attitudes Study, and to have complete information about religious identification (yes or no). A total of `r n_participants` individuals met these criteria and were included in the study. 

<!-- The proportion of missing data for each variable by wave is describe in [Appendix A](#appendix-a) @tbl-baseline. -->



### Missing Data


To mitigate bias from missing data, we employed the `ppm` algorithm from the `mice` package in R [@vanbuuren2018] to impute missing responses.  Overall missingness reponses accounted for less than 1% of total responses (`r prop_miss_case`).


## Results 

Demographic data stratified by "Muslim"/"Not Muslim" are presented in @tbl-demography. @tbl-sample presents demographic data stratified by religious denominations.
