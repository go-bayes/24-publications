title: "Causal effects of owning pets on multi-dimensional well-being"
abstract: |
  This study rigorously assesses the causal impact of pet ownership, specifically acquiring cats or dogs, on various dimensions of human well-being among New Zealanders. Using data from the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS) spanning 2015 to 2020, we employ a robust methodological framework for causal inference. Our framework incorporates targeted machine learning models to balance confounders and doubly-robust methods for causal estimation, utilising Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE). Cat ownership: results offer only provisional and weak evidence for causal effects of cat ownership on health and well-being, notably a loss of sleep. Dog ownership: results offer only provisional and weak evidence for causal effects of cat ownership on health and well-being, namely: greater exercise. The study has implications for understanding the complexities of causal relationships in non-experimental settings where randomised experiments are not feasible and offers a template for future research in the area of pet ownership and psycho-social well-being.

## Introduction

Whether pets benefit their owners is a question of perennial fascination and debate. Research abounds on the physical and psychological effects of pet ownership, often highlighting benefits such as reduced stress levels, increased physical activity, and better overall well-being. However, the majority of these studies, including our own previous work [@fraser2020], rely heavily on correlational analyses. Thus, questions concerning the causal impact of pet ownership on human health and psychological well-being remain unanswered.

Traditional studies, even those of longitudinal design, have been limited in establishing causality for several reasons:

First, pet ownership cannot be randomised. For example ethical considerations prohibit the random allocation of pets to households. However, absent randomisation we cannot fully ensure that association between pet ownership and well-being is causal.

Second, and relatedly, there are numerous confounding variables that can affect both pet ownership and the outcomes under study, such as socio-economic status, lifestyle, and health status. Such confounders may introduce bias, making it challenging to isolate the specific effects of pet ownership.

Third, large scale panel datasets are rare; where they exist, they have yet to be employed to address causality. Thus, opportunities for causal analysis in this area await.

Here, to address these limitations and provide a robust methodological framework for causal inference, we adopt the following strategies:

1.  **Clarify the causal question:** prior to any analysis, it is crucial to explicitly define the causal question under scrutiny. Within the umbrella term of "pet ownership," multiple scenarios can be considered: coming to own a cat, coming to own a dog, coming to own other animals, parting with one or several types of pet, and so forth. Here, for the sake of causal clarity, we focus on two population average treatment effects: (a) the impact of acquiring cats and (b) the impact of acquiring dogs. Each scenario is conceptualised as a randomised experiment, contrasting a population that acquires the animal with one that does not. Effects are summarised for the population.

2.  **Clearly define the target population**: the study's findings are intended to generalise to New Zealanders from the baseline wave 2015 of the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS), who may have acquired or lost pets in the next available wave for which the NZAVS has measures of pet ownership: NZAVS wave 2019. We measure the outcomes as "intention-to-treat" effects in NZAVS wave 2020, and apply population weights from the New Zealand Census for year wave 2020 to obtain valid estimates for the New Zealand population in 2020-2021.

3.  **Ensure correct temporal order in the variables**: the study's design incorporates a clear temporal structure for confounders and outcomes. Confounders are assessed prior to the treatment, negating the risk of post-treatment bias. Outcomes pertaining to well-being are evaluated after the treatment, thereby reducing the potential for reverse causation. This structure underpins the causal flow from pet ownership to well-being.

4.  **Balance confounders**: once the temporal structure is set, we adjust for confounders that could distort the causal link between pet ownership and well-being. We employ doubly-robust methods using the `lmtp` package in R [@williams2021]. These methods amalgamate targeted machine learning models for both the treatment and the outcome variables. Being doubly robust, the analysis can recover consistent causal estimates even if either model is misspecified [@hoffman2023].

5.  **Include of baseline measures of the treatment and outcome**: after confounder adjustment, we introduce baseline measures for both the treatment and the outcomes. This strategy serves two objectives: first, it augments control for confounding variables, and second, it permits differentiation between "incidence" and "prevalence" effects. *Incidence effects* capture the emergence of new cases or conditions among individuals who acquire pets during the study. This facilitates an evaluation of the causal impact of pet adoption on well-being among those who were not pet owners at the baseline.

6.  **Assess multiple dimensions of well-being**: we use an outcomewide approach [@vanderweele2020] to assess well-being effects across multiple dimensions within the same study. This approach has several benefits. First we obtain *contextualised effects*: each outcome is evaluated in context relative to the others. This facilitates a better understanding of the importance of each individual effect within the overarching construct of well-being. Second, we *mitigate* of spurious findings: by assessing multiple outcomes simultaneously, we minimise the risk of cherry-picking cases that confirm a preconceived hypothesis, thereby reducing the likelihood of chance findings. Third, we *accelerate sientific understanding*: a comprehensive assessment can fast-track our scientific insights into the potential advantages and disadvantages of pet ownership on various aspects of human well-being. The selection of outcomes below are based on previous studies reflecting interest in the relationship between pet ownership and (1) health, (2) embodied well-being and distress, (3) reflective well-being and (4) social well-being.

7.  **Obtain methodological precision through TMLE and machine learning**: to address the intrinsic limitations of non-randomised pet ownership, our study employs Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) coupled with machine learning techniques (the `SuperLearner` library in R [@polley2023]). These advanced methodological enhancement offer the following benefits. First, our approach *reduces model dependence*: TMLE allows for doubly-robust causal inference, reducing reliance on correct model specification. The method is robust even if either the treatment model (i.e., pet ownership) or the outcome model (i.e., well-being indicators) is incorrectly specified. Second, *machine Learning for confounder balancing improves precision* further refines our ability to balance confounders, particularly when these are high-dimensional or interact in complex ways. Flexible semi-parametric estimation of parameters that are of no intrinsic interest (the control variables) protects inference from model mis-specification [@díaz2021].

Collectively, this approach help us to contribute to a deeper, more rigorous understanding of the causal relationship between cat or dog ownership and human well-being.(For further discussions of our approach, see: [@bulbulia2023a; @bulbulia2023; @bulbulia2022; @vanderweele2015; @hernan2023])

## Method

### Sample

Data were collected as part of The New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS) is an annual longitudinal national probability panel study of social attitudes, personality, ideology and health outcomes. The NZAVS began in 2009. It includes questionnaire responses from more almost 70,000 New Zealand residents. The study includes researchers from many New Zealand universities, including the University of Auckland, Victoria University of Wellington, the University of Canterbury, the University of Otago, and Waikato University. Because the survey asks the same people to respond each year, it can track subtle change in attitudes and values over time, and is an important resource for researchers both in New Zealand and around the world. The NZAVS is university-based, not- for-profit and independent of political or corporate funding.https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/75SNB

### Assumptions Underlying Causal Inference

The objective of this study is to ascertain whether an intervention engenders a distinct outcome. Given the observational limitations, we cannot directly examine both the factual and counterfactual states. To circumvent this obstacle, we estimate the population average treatment effect (PATE) by contrasting the mean outcomes of the treated and untreated groups.

Three pivotal assumptions are requisite for causal attribution:

1.  **Causal Consistency**: We assume that the observed outcomes align with those that would have materialised under the intervention. Furthermore, we assume non-interference between individual units; each subject's outcome solely hinges on their treatment status. This assumption may be violated if the intervention lacks precise definition.

2.  **Exchangeability**: We postulate that, given specific observed covariates, the treatment assignment is independent of potential outcomes. In psychological research, this resembles random assignment to experimental conditions. In observational settings, we simulate this through controlling for confounding variables that might spuriously link the treatment to the outcome.

3.  **Positivity**: The assumption here is that every subject has a non-zero probability of receiving the treatment, irrespective of covariates. Two scenarios can undermine positivity:

-   *Random non-positivity*: Occurs when a supposed causal effect pertains to unobserved instances. Data can be employed to validate this.
-   *Deterministic non-positivity*: Arises when a causal effect is fundamentally implausible, such as considering the causal impact of a hysterectomy on biological males [@hernan2023].

These assumptions facilitate a rigorous and meaningful comparison between treated and untreated subjects. They enable us to infer the global impact of the intervention, notwithstanding the inability to observe counterfactual outcomes directly.

### Causal identification strategy

Effects should temporally succeed their causes. To circumvent reverse causation issues, outcomes were assessed in the year succeeding exposure, specifically the 2020 wave of the NZAVS. The causal diagram in @fig-outcomewide-dag outlines our approach to confounding control. We align with @vanderweele2020 in employing a *modified disjunctive cause criterion*, articulated as follows:

1.  **Identify all relevant factors**: initially, enumerate all covariates affecting either the exposure or the outcomes across five domains, or both. These factors encompass variables influencing exposure or outcome and variables that could be consequences of such factors

2.  **Remove instrumental variables**: subsequently, remove any factors identified as instrumental variables—factors influencing the exposure but not the outcome. The inclusion of instrumental variables diminishes efficiency.

3.  **Include proxy variables for unmeasured common causes**: for unmeasured variables affecting both exposure and outcome, attempt to include a proxy variable. A proxy serves as a consequent of the unmeasured variable.

4.  **Control for previous exposure**: Accounting for prior exposure is imperative for assessing incident exposure as opposed to prevalent exposure. This step enhances confounding control and aids in sidestepping reverse causation and other unmeasured confounders. It ensures that any unmeasured confounder would need to affect both the outcome and the initial exposure, regardless of prior exposure levels, to account for an observed exposure-outcome association [@danaei2012; @hernan2023].

5.  **Control for baseline outcome**:Controlling for the outcome at baseline is crucial for ruling out reverse causation. While this does not fully preclude reverse causation, it minimises its impact. Therefore, the baseline outcome, along with a comprehensive set of covariates, should be part of the model to render the confounding control assumption plausible. The baseline outcome often serves as the most potent confounder affecting both the exposure and subsequent outcome [@vanderweele2020].

To mitigate bias from missing data due to non-response or panel attrition, we imputed missing values using the mice package in R [@vanbuuren2018]. To address non-response or missingness at follow-up, we employed censoring weights, integrated into our semi-parametric models. Valid inferences for the New Zealand population were secured by applying post-stratification census weights for age, European ethnicity, and gender.

### Study 1: eligibility criteria for inclusion in the causal effects of cat ownership

The sample consisted of respondents to NZAVS waves 2015 (baseline), 2019 (exposure wave), and 2020 (outcome wave) (years 2015-2021) (See Appendix A.)

#### Inclusion Criteria

-   Participants who provided full information provided about pets at baseline and the exposure wave (NZAVS wave 2019)
-   Participants with missing data for all variables at baseline were allowed. Missing data were multiply imputed through the `mice` package [@vanbuuren2018].
-   Participants without pets at baseline or those with cats.
-   Participants without pets or those with cats at the exposure wave (NZAVS wave 2019).

#### Exclusion Criteria

-   Participants who had any other pets at baseline (wave 2015) or the exposure wave (NZAVS wave 2019) other than cats.
-   We allowed loss-to-follow up in the outcome wave (NZAVS wave 2020); missing values owing to attrition and non-response were were handled using censoring weights (see details of the `lmtp` package [@williams2021]).

There were `r n_cats` NZAVS participants who met these criteria.

@tbl-transition is a transition matrix describes the shifts from one state of meaning of life to another state between the baseline wave and the following wave. The numbers in the cells represent the number of individuals who transitioned from one state (rows) to another (columns). For example, the cell in the first row and second column shows the number of individuals who transitioned from the first state (indicated by the left-most cell in the row) to the second state. The top left cell shows the number of individuals who remained in the first state. We find evidence for both change in the exposure between the baseline wave and the exposure wave (wave 18) among the `r n_cats` participants, thus satisifying the positivity assumpition (see below).

The sample consisted of respondents to NZAVS waves 2015 (baseline), 2019 (exposure wave), and 2020 (outcome wave) (years 2015-2021) (See Appendix A.)

Inclusion criteria for the cats an dogs analysis were the same as for the cats analysis, replacing "dogs" for "cats". There were `r n_dogs` NZAVS participants who met these criteria.

### Multi-dimensional indicators of well-being

We assessed well-being following @vanderweele2020 outcome-wide template. Outcomewide studies argue that, rather than cherry-picking one or several domains of well-being, science may advance more rapidly, and with greater hope for replication, by assess well-being across as many range of indicators the data may afford. To assist with interpretation, @vanderweele2020 groups well-being into larger dimensions of interest. Here, we identify five-domains: health, embodied well-being, practical well-being, reflective well-being, and social well-being (see Appendix C.)

These allow us to ask, how strong would the unmeasured confounder need to be in its association with the treatment and the outcome to explain away the observed association."

### Statistical Estimation: Targeted Maximum Likelihood and Longitudinal Modified Treatment Policies

To consistently compute the causal relationship between pet ownership and well-being, we employ Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) for doubly-robust causal inference. This methodology synthesises treatment and outcome models, thereby fortifying the study against potential model misspecification.


### Definitions

**Treatment Model**: in the context of causal inference, a treatment model estimates the likelihood of receiving the treatment—here, pet ownership—based on observed characteristics (covariates). In ordinary regression, this would be akin to the predictor variables in the model, but modelling the treatment, in this case pet ownership.

**Outcome Model**: this estimates the potential outcomes of interest, here, measures of well-being, conditional on treatment status and other covariates. In traditional regression settings, this model is what you typically fit to understand how predictors influence the outcome. 

By using TMLE to combine both a treatment and outcome model, we can better identify the specific effect of pet ownership on multi-dimensional well-being. Here are the steps: 

1.  **Treatment model with propensity scores**: the initial phase of our analysis consists of generating propensity scores for the exposure for each participant. These scores quantify the probability of an individual becoming a pet owner, conditional on their set of covariates. The scores emerge from a targeted machine learning model that accounts for high-dimensional confounders to estimate treatment assignment probabilities, namely pet ownership. **In plain terms,** we first calculate a score for each person that indicates how likely they are to own a pet based on various characteristics.This step is like determining each person's odds of having a pet, given their particular life circumstances.

2.  **Weighting via propensity scores**: upon computing the propensity scores, we assign an inverse probability weight to each dataset entry. These weights serve to equilibrate the distribution of observed covariates between the treated and untreated cohorts, thus attenuating the bias in the causal estimates. **In plain terms,** we use propensity scores to make the contrasts groups more comparable in a manner that emulates randomisation in experiments.

3.  **Outcome models focused on well-being**: a second targeted machine learning model focuses on the outcome variables, encompassing 18 measures of well-being distributed across four domains. This model incorporates both the individual treatment statuses and the previously calculated weights, enhancing our capacity for causal inference. **In plain terms** we create a model that tries to predict well-being levels based on whether someone owns a pet, while also considering the balancing weights.
Put differently: this stage is about linking pet ownership to well-being, but with the added advantage of using balanced groups for a more credible result.

4.  **Counterfactual contrasts**: a core component of TMLE is the projection of counterfactual outcomes. By combining estimates from the treatment and outcome models, TMLE enables the computation of potential well-being levels for each individual under dual treatment conditions—both with and without pet ownership. **In plain terms:** we use the models to estimate what someone's well-being would likely be in both scenarios: owning a pet and not owning one. Note that our shift estimand, described below, helps to make the assumptions required for such contrasts more credible.  We will contrast the average population outcome if all were to own pets with the naturally occurring from the distribution of pet ownership in the treatment year (NZAVS wave 2019)

5.  **Effect estimation**: the final analytical stage involves determining the average treatment effect by contrasting the estimated counterfactual outcomes. We specifically gauge the differential impact on predicted well-being between the contrasting treatment states—possession and absence of a pet. Thus we calculate the average difference in well-being that owning a pet makes if everyone were to own pets. **In plain terms**, this last step boils down to measuring how much better or worse people are likely to feel if they own a pet.

Each of these steps contributes to a robust methodology for examining the *causal* relationship between pet ownership and well-being. The marriage of TMLE and machine learning technologies reduces the dependence on restrictive modelling assumptions and introduces an additional layer of robustness. This integration serves as a particularly robust analytical framework for causal inference in examining the relationship between pet ownership and human well-being. For an extended discussion, refer to(For further details see [@hoffman2022; @hoffman2023; @díaz2021]

### Shift estimand for Longitudional Modified Treatment Strategies

Here, we adopt a "shift" estimand, an alternative to conventional causal estimands that often compare full exposure levels against one another[@díaz2021]. This estimand allows for nuanced comparisons of hypothetical interventions, enhancing causal inference. In our case, we evaluate the effect of universal pet ownership—cats in Study 1 and dogs in Study 2—relative to the natural state of owning or not owning a pet. This methodology is implemented using the `lmtp` package in R [@williams2021].

One key advantage of the shift estimand is its capacity for generating actionable policy insights. It allows us to address questions like, "What would happen if everyone owned a pet?" without requiring an extreme counterfactual where everyone is forced to forego pet ownership for comparison.

The shift estimand also eases the demands related to positivity assumptions. Enforcing an intervention where people must relinquish their pets may not be feasible, either ethically or practically. Hence, the shift estimand provides a more attainable and sensible analytical framework. Moreover, as indicated in Appendix C, the shift estimand tends to produce slightly more conservative estimates, which adds an extra layer of robustness to our findings, enhancing their reliability for policy implications.

### Discussion Study 1: causal effects of cat ownership on multi-dimensional well-being

Our analyses reveals little evidence to support strong causal claims about the impact of owning a cat, for those who previously did not own cats, on multiple dimensions of well-being. The Population Average Treatment Effects (PATE) across outcomes largely hovered around zero, with confidence intervals spanning both sides of the null.

**General trends**: across domains such as alcohol consumption, body mass index, exercise, and psychological well-being, PATE causal contrasts were small and accompanied by E-values that suggest no reliable evidence for causality. This held true for outcomes like alcohol frequency, BMI, exercise hours, and several facets of psychological well-being.

**Sleep**: the outcome that stood apart was 'Hours sleep'. Here, the PATE causal contrast was -0.057 with a confidence interval ranging from -0.096 to -0.018. The associated E-value of 1.291 suggests that there is reliable evidence for causality. However, the evidence only provisionally supports the notion that gaining a cat may lead to a reduction in sleep hours, and even here the effect size is modest.

**Outliers**: another outcome worth noting is 'PWB your relationships', which had a PATE causal contrast of -0.038. Though the E-value of 1.228 indicates weak evidence for causality, this could be an area for further investigation.

The results thus prompt caution in making substantive claims about the causal impacts of pet ownership, particularly in gaining a cat, on well-being for the New Zealand population.

### Discussion Study 2: causal effects of dog ownership on multi-dimensional well-being

Among the array of outcomes studied in relation to acquiring a dog, only one indicator provided reliable evidence for a causal effect---exercise. Specifically, the Population Average Treatment Effect (PATE) for 'Hours exercise' was 0.074, with a confidence interval ranging from 0.007 to 0.142 and an E-value of 1.343. This suggests that gaining a dog leads to a modest but statistically significant increase in exercise for individuals who socialise at least two hours per week.

For all other outcomes examined---ranging from body mass index (BMI) and alcohol consumption to various psychological well-being markers---there was no reliable evidence supporting a causal relationship. Confidence intervals for these outcomes generally crossed zero, and E-values fell short of indicating strong evidence for causality.

Thus, we find limited support for the proposition that acquiring a dog causally affects human well-being, with evidence restricted to exercise levels.

### Summary of findings

The expected diminution of sleep resulting from cat ownership in the general population is estimated to be about *four minutes* per night This appears modest, but the level of confidence in this finding is relatively high. In contrast, the expected augmentation in exercise from dog ownership is about *ten minutes* per week. The size of this effect may appear modest but is backed by relatively strong evidence.

Note further that the modest effect sizes found in our analyses, particularly a loss of about ten minutes of sleep per week for cat owners and an increase of approximately four minutes of exercise per night for dog owners, should be interpreted with caution. Our study sets a high bar for evidence, relying on robust statistical methods that control for confounding variables and strive for generalisability. However, the Population Average Treatment Effects (PATE) reported are just that---averages across the population contrasting ownership with what would have been observed, on average, had there been no shift in ownership.

### Assumptions and limitations

1.  **Causality and confounding**: we employs rigorous causal inference techniques, but these are contingent on the assumption of no unmeasured confounding. (Say more about E-values...)

2.  **Measurement error**: the variables under consideration---exercise and sleep---are self-reported, which might introduce both systematic and random measurement errors. It should be specifically noted that the apparent modesty of the practical effects could arise, in part, to measurement inaccuracy. Given the limitations of self-report measures, the true effect sizes may differ from those estimated. Therefore, while the evidence does suggest a modest impact, the actual real-world effects may be either smaller or larger than the estimates suggest. Given the modest effect sizes and the limitations of self-report measures, future research should explore the use of more objective measures for variables like exercise and sleep. (... etc.)

3.  **Generalisability and transportability**: our findings should be interpreted within the context of the New Zealand population from which the data were sourced. Although the results may have broader relevance, direct extrapolation to different populations or sociocultural settings should be undertaken cautiously.

### Theoretical and practical relevance

This study contributes to an emerging but still limited body of scholarly work on the causal impacts of pet ownership on various dimensions of human well-being. Notably, the study employs advanced causal inference methods, offering a potential methodological framework for future investigations in this area.

Although the observed effect sizes are modest, they are not necessary trivial. Decisions around pet ownership should consider the full range of potential impacts, both positive and negative, on well-being -- and of course, on the animals themselves. However, it would be premature to recommend pet ownership as a strategy for large improvements in well-being, based on the current evidence.

## Appendix A. Measures

#### Age (waves: 1-15)

We asked participants' age in an open-ended question ("What is your age?" or "What is your date of birth").

#### Disability (waves: 5-15)

We assessed disability with a one item indicator adapted from @verbrugge1997, that asks "Do you have a health condition or disability that limits you, and that has lasted for 6+ months?" (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

#### Education Attainment (waves: 1, 4-15)

Participants were asked "What is your highest level of qualification?". We coded participans highest finished degree according to the New Zealand Qualifications Authority. Ordinal-Rank 0-10 NZREG codes (with overseas school quals coded as Level 3, and all other ancillary categories coded as missing) See:https://www.nzqa.govt.nz/assets/Studying-in-NZ/New-Zealand-Qualification-Framework/requirements-nzqf.pdf

#### Employment (waves: 1-3, 4-11)

We asked participants "Are you currently employed? (This includes self-employed or casual work)". \* note: This question disappeared in the updated NZAVS Technical documents (Data Dictionary).

#### European (waves: 1-15)

Participants were asked "Which ethnic group do you belong to (NZ census question)?" or "Which ethnic group(s) do you belong to? (Open-ended)" (wave: 3). Europeans were coded as 1, whereas other ethnicities were coded as 0.

#### Ethnicity (waves: 3)

Based on the New Zealand Cencus, we asked participants "Which ethnic group(s) do you belong to?". The responses were: (1) New Zealand European; (2) Māori; (3) Samoan; (4) Cook Island Māori; (5) Tongan; (6) Niuean; (7) Chinese; (8) Indian; (9) Other such as DUTCH, JAPANESE, TOKELAUAN. Please state:. We coded their answers into four groups: Maori, Pacific, Asian, and Euro (except for Time 3, which used an open-ended measure).

#### Gender (waves: 1-15)

We asked participants' gender in an open-ended question: "what is your gender?" or "Are you male or female?" (waves: 1-5). Female was coded as 0, Male was coded as 1, and gender diverse coded as 3 [@fraser_coding_2020]. (or 0.5 = neither female nor male)

#### Income (waves: 1-3, 4-15)

Participants were asked "Please estimate your total household income (before tax) for the year XXXX". To stablise this indicator, we first took the natural log of the response + 1, and then centred and standardised the log-transformed indicator.

<!-- #### Job Security (waves: 1-3,4-7,9-15) -->

<!-- Participants indicated their feeling of job security by answering "How secure do you feel in your current job?" on a scale from 1 (not secure) to 7 (very secure). -->

<!-- #### Parent (waves: 5-15) -->

<!-- Participants were asked "If you are a parent, what is the birth date of your eldest child?" or "If you are a parent, in which year was your eldest child born?" (waves: 10-15). Parents were coded as 1, while the others were coded as 0. -->

#### Number of Children (waves: 1-3, 4-15)

We measured number of children using one item from @Bulbulia_2015. We asked participants "How many children have you given birth to, fathered, or adopted. How many children have you given birth to, fathered, or adopted?" or ""How many children have you given birth to, fathered, or adopted. How many children have you given birth to, fathered, and/or parented?" (waves: 12-15).

#### Political Orientation

We measured participants' political orientation using a single item adapted from @jost_end_2006-1.

"Please rate how politically liberal versus conservative you see yourself as being."

(1 = Extremely Liberal to 7 = Extremely Conservative)

#### NZSEI-13 (waves: 8-15)

We assessed occupational prestige and status using the New Zealand Socio-economic Index 13 (NZSEI-13) [@fahy2017]. This index uses the income, age, and education of a reference group, in this case the 2013 New Zealand census, to calculate an score for each occupational group. Scores range from 10 (Lowest) to 90 (Highest). This list of index scores for occupational groups was used to assign each participant a NZSEI-13 score based on their occupation.

Participants were asked "If you are a parent, what is the birth date of your eldest child?".

#### Living with Partner

Participants were asekd "Do you live with your partner?" (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

#### Living in an Urban Area (waves: 1-15)

We coded whether they are living in an urban or rural area (1 = Urban, 0 = Rural) based on the addresses provided.

We coded whether they are living in an urban or rural area (1 = Urban, 0 = Rural) based on the addresses provided.

#### NZ Deprivation Index (waves: 1-15)

We used the NZ Deprivation Index to assign each participant a score based on where they live [@atkinson2019]. This score combines data such as income, home ownership, employment, qualifications, family structure, housing, and access to transport and communication for an area into one deprivation score.

#### NZ-Born (waves: 1-2,4-15)

We asked participants "Which country were you born in?" or "Where were you born? (please be specific, e.g., which town/city?)" (waves: 6-15).

#### Mini-IPIP 6 (waves: 1-3,4-15)

We measured participants personality with the Mini International Personality Item Pool 6 (Mini-IPIP6) [@sibley2011] which consists of six dimensions and each dimensions is measured with four items:

1.  agreeableness,

    i.  I sympathize with others' feelings.

### Exposure variable

Pets descriptoion here.

### Health well-being outcomes

#### Alcohol Frequency (waves: 6-15)

We measured participants' frequency of drinking alcohol using one item adapted from @Ministry_of_Health_2013 . Participants were asked "How often do you have a drink containing alcohol?" (1 = Never - I don't drink, 2 = Monthly or less, 3 = Up to 4 times a month, 4 = Up to 3 times a week, 5 = 4 or more times a week, 6 = Don't know).

#### Alcohol Intensity (waves: 6-15)

We measured participants' intensity of drinking alcohol using one item adapted from [@Ministry_of_Health_2013]. Participants were asked "How many drinks containing alcohol do you have on a typical day when drinking alcohol? (number of drinks on a typical day when drinking)"

#### Body Mass Index (waves: 2-3, 4-15)

Participants were asked "What is your height? (metres)" and "What is your weight? (kg)". Based on participants indication of their height and weight we calculated the BMI by dividing the weight in kilograms by the square of the height in meters.

#### Short-Form Subjective Health (waves: 5-15)

Participants' subjective health was assessed by three items selected from the MOS 36-item short-form health survey [@warejr1992]. The items were

```         
1.  "In general, would you say your health is...";
2.  "I seem to get sick a little easier than most people.";
3.  "I expect my health to get worse." Participants responded to those items on a scale (1 = Poor to 7 = Excellent).
```

The second and third items were negatively-worded, so we reversed the responses.

#### Hours of Exercise (waves: 1, 4-15)

We measured hours of exercising using one item from @sibley2011. We asked participants to estimate and report how many hours they spend in exercise/physical activity last week. To stablise this indicator, we first took the natural log of the response + 1, and then centred and standardised the log-transformed indicator.

#### Hours of Sleep (waves: 5-15)

Participants were asked "During the past month, on average, how many hours of *actual sleep* did you get per night".

#### Smoker (waves: 4-15)

We asked participants whether they are currently smoking or not (1 = Yes or 0 = No), using a single item: "Do you currently smoke?" or "Do you currently smoke tobacco cigarettes?" (waves: 10-15) from @muriwai_looking_2018.

### Embodied well-being outcomes

#### Kessler-6 (waves: 2-3,4-15)

We measured psychological distress using the Kessler-6 scale [@kessler2002], which exhibits strong diagnostic concordance for moderate and severe psychological distress in large, cross-cultural samples [@kessler2010; @prochaska2012]. Participants rated during the past 30 days, how often did... (

```         
1.  "... you feel hopeless";
2.  "... you feel so depressed that nothing could cheer you up";
3.  "... you feel restless or fidgety";
4.  "... you feel that everything was an effort";
5.  "... you feel worthless";
6.  " you feel nervous?"
```

Ordinal response options for the Kessler-6 are: "None of the time"; "A little of the time"; "Some of the time"; "Most of the time"; "All of the time."

#### Fatigue (waves: 5-15)

We assessed subjective fatigue by asking participants, "During the last 30 days, how often did ... you feel exhausted?" Responses were collected on an ordinal scale (0 = None of The Time, 1 = A little of The Time, 2 = Some of The Time, 3 = Most of The Time, 4 = All of The Time).

#### Rumination

"During the last 30 days, how often did.... you have negative thoughts that repeated over and over?"

Ordinal response options for the Kessler-6 are: "None of the time"; "A little of the time"; "Some of the time"; "Most of the time"; "All of the time."

<!-- ### Practical well-being outcomes -->

<!-- #### Body Satisfaction (waves: 2-3, 4-15) -->

<!-- We measured body satisfaction with one item from @stronge_facebook_2015: "I am satisfied with the appearance, size and shape of my body", which participants rated from 1 (very inaccurate) to 7 (very accurate). -->

<!-- #### Emotional Regulation (waves: 10-13) -->

<!-- We measured participants' levels of emotional regulation using three items adpated from @gratz_multidimensional_2004 and @gross_individual_2003: -->

<!-- ```          -->

<!-- 1.  "When I feel negative emotions, my emotions feel out of control."; -->

<!-- 2.  "When I feel negative emotions, I suppress or hide my emotions."; -->

<!-- 3.  "When I feel negative emotions, I change the way I think to help me stay calm." -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Participants were asked to indicate the extent to which they agree with these items (1 = Strongly Disagree to 7 = Strongly Agree). -->

<!-- #### Perfectionism (waves: 10-15) -->

<!-- We assessed participants' perfectionism using three items from @rice_short_2014: (1) Doing my best never seems to be enough; (2) My performance rarely measures up to my standards; (3) I am hardly ever satisfied with my performance. Participants indicated the extent to which they agree with these items (1 = Strongly Disagree to 7 = Strongly Agree). -->

<!-- #### Power Dependence -->

<!-- Participants' Power dependence was measured using two items: -->

<!-- ```          -->

<!-- 1." I do not have enough power or control over important parts of my life." -->

<!-- 2". Other people have too much power or control over important parts of my life.  -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Participants indicated their agreement with these items" (1 = Strongly Disagree to 7 = Strongly Agree). -->

<!-- <!-- #### Self-Respect (waves: 3, 4-11, 15) -->

<!-- <!-- We assessed participants' levels of self-respect using an item adapted from @tyler_understanding_1996. Participant indicated the extent to which they agree with the statement ("If they knew me, most NZers would respect what I have accomplished in life") on a likert scale (1 = Strongly Disagree to 7 = Strongly Agree) -->

<!-- #### Self-Control (waves: 5-15) -->

<!-- Participants were asked to indicate the extent to which they endorse the two items -->

<!-- ```          -->

<!-- 1.  "In general, I have a lot of self-control" -->

<!-- 2.  "I wish I had more self-discipline" -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- The scale is from @tangney_high_2004. The responses to the items ranged from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 7 (Strongly Agree). -->

<!-- #### Self-Esteem (waves: 1-3, 4-15) -->

<!-- We measured participants' self-esteem using three items adapted from @Rosenberg1965. Participants were instructed to circle the number that best represents how accurately each statement describes them. Participants responded to the items -->

<!-- ```          -->

<!-- 1.  "On the whole am satisfied with myself" -->

<!-- 2.  "Take a positive attitude toward myself" -->

<!-- 3.  "Am inclined to feel that I am a failure") on a likert-type scale (1 = Very inaccurate to 7 = Very accurate). -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- #### Sexual Satisfaction (waves: 10-15) -->

<!-- Participants were asked "How satisfied are you with your sex life?" (1 = Not satisfied to 7 = Very satisfied). -->

<!-- #### Vengeful Rumination (waves: 10-15) -->

<!-- We assessed participants' vengeful rumination using three items, respectively adapted from @caprara_indicators_1986 and @berry_forgivingness_2005, and developed for NZAVS: (1) Sometimes I can't sleep because of thinking about past wrongs I have suffered; (2) I can usually forgive and forget when someone does me wrong; (3) I find myself regularly thinking about past times that I have been wronged. Participants indicated their agreement with these items (1 = Strongly Disagree to 7 = Strongly Agree). The values for the second item were reversely coded. -->

### Reflective well-being

#### Satisfaction with Life (waves: 1-3,4-15)

We measured life satisfaction with two items adapted from the Satisfaction with Life Scale [@diener1985]:

```         
1.  "I am satisfied with my life" and
2.  "In most ways my life is close to ideal".
```

Participants responded on a scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 7 (Strongly Agree).

#### Personal Wellbeing (waves: 1-3, 4-15)

We measured participants' subjective wellbeing using three items from the Australian Unity Wellbeing Index [@cummins_developing_2003]:

```         
1.  Your health;
2.  Your standard of living;
3.  Your future security; 4 Your personal relationships.
```

Participants read an instruction ("The following items assess your current satisfaction with different aspects of your life and aspects of New Zealand more generally") and indicated their satisfaction with those items (0 = Completely Dissatisfied to 10 = Completely Satisfied).

#### Standard Living

We measured participants' satisfaction with their standard of living using an item from the Australian Unity Wellbeing Index [@cummins_developing_2003]. Participants read an instruction ("Please rate your level of satisfaction with the following aspects of your life and New Zealand.") and responded to an item

```         
- "Your standard of living"
```

on a 10-point scale (0 = completely dissatisfied to 10 = completely satisfied).

### Social well-being outcomes

#### Felt Belongingness (waves: 1-3, 4-15)

We assessed felt belongingness with three items adapted from the Sense of Belonging Instrument [@hagerty1995]:

```         
1.  "Know that people in my life accept and value me";
2.  "Feel like an outsider";
```

3.  "Know that people around me share my attitudes and beliefs".

Participants responded on a scale from 1 (Very Inaccurate) to 7 (Very Accurate). The second item was reversely coded.

#### Sense of Community (waves: 6-15)

We measured sense of community with a single item from @sengupta2013: "I feel a sense of community with others in my local neighbourhood." Participants answered on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).

#### Support (waves: 1-3, 4-15)

Participants' perceived social support was measured using three items from @cutrona1987 and @williams_cyberostracism_2000:

```         
1.  "There are people I can depend on to help me if I really need it";
2.  "There is no one I can turn to for guidance in times of stress";
3.  "I know there are people I can turn to when I need help." 
```

Participants indicated the extent to which they agree with those items (1 = Strongly Disagree to 7 = Strongly Agree).

The second item was negatively-worded, so we reversely recorded the responses to this item.

<!-- #### Volunteers (waves: 1, 4-15) -->

<!-- Participants were asked,"Please estimate how many hours you spent doing each of the following things last week" and responded to an item ("voluntary/charitable work"), from [@sibley2011]. -->

Here, we consider two distinct types of estimands: the shift estimand and the traditional all-or-nothing estimand. The shift estimand aims to quantify the change in expected well-being when individuals transition from non-ownership to pet ownership, set against the current distribution of pet owners and non-owners in the population. In contrast, the traditional all-or-nothing estimand compares expected well-being under conditions of universal pet ownership versus no pet ownership at all.

n Study 1, we observed an effect of cat ownership on sleep. For comparative insights, one may ask: What would the traditional estimand reveal? Refer to @fig-comparative-graph-cats and @tbl-comparative-graph-cats. These show that the traditional estimand, although less precise, reveals the traditional intervention would have stronger effects than the shift estimand. This is expected given the traditional estimand requires a more substantial intervention and greater data dependency for exposure balance.

Study 2 examined a effect of dog ownership on exercise across the population were everyone to own dogs. The contrast condition for this intervention was the natural distribution of dog ownership in the population. Again, we might wonder: What insights would the traditional estimand offer? See @fig-comparative-graph-dogs and @tbl-comparative-graph-dogs for a comparative analysis. Similar to the cat study, the traditional estimand yields stronger but less precise results, owing to a more extensive intervention and higher data requirements for balance.

It is important to recognise that each estimand poses a different research question, leading to distinct intervention implications. The shift estimand yields more conservative results, aligning with current pet ownership behaviours. Beyond increased efficiency and fewer assumptions, the shift estimand has the advantage of a potentially more immediate policy relevance. The insights it offers could guide policy makers interested in promoting pet ownership without necessarily discouraging current pet owners.

### Appendix D. Population Average Treatment Effect {.appendix}

As indicated in the main manuscript, the Average Treatment Effects is obtained by contrasting the expected outcome when a population sampled is exposed to an exposure level, $E[Y(A = a)]$, with the expected outcome under a different exposure level, $E[Y(A=a')]$.

For a binary treatment with levels $A=0$ and $A=1$, the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), on the difference scale, is expressed:

$$ATE_{\text{risk difference}} = E[Y(1)|L] - E[Y(0)|L]$$

On the risk ratio scale, the ATE is expressed:

$$ATE_{\text{risk ratio}} = \frac{E[Y(1)|L]}{E[Y(0)|L]}$$

Other effect scales, such as the incidence rate ratio, incidence rate difference, or hazard ratio, might also be of interest.

Here we estimate the Population Average Treatment Effect (PATE), which denotes the effect the treatment would have on the New Population if applied universally. This quantity can be expressed:

$$PATE_{\text{risk difference}} = f(E[Y(1) - Y(0)|L], W)$$

$$PATE_{\text{risk ratio}} = f\left(\frac{E[Y(1)|L]}{E[Y(0)|L]}, W\right)$$

where $f$ is a function that incorporates post-stratification weights $W$ into the estimation of the expected outcomes from which we obtain causal contrasts. Because the NZAVS is national probability sample, i.e. inverse probability of being sampled 1. However, to incorporate gender, age, and ethnic differences we include post-stratification weight into our outcome wide models.
